            Erin Chambers Created 'iodineandgasoline-copy' so as to not overwrite
            Lucas' work. Encoded Chapter III.

               <p> No words that I am capable of writing can add to the splendid reputation of
                  the <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Sanitary Train</a>. Let the mute
                  testimony of the shell-shattered ambulances and shell-destroyed hospital of
                  <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-cha">Champagne</a> be made of record. The
                  watchword of the <a href="organizations.html#secfh">Field Hospital Section</a> was
                   "Instant Service,"  and no dangers restrained the <a href="organizations.html#secam">Ambulance Section</a> from pushing its

               </p>
               
               <p> The record of 22,260 patients evacuated from the firing line during action
                  by the <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Sanitary Train</a> is a record of
                  which every officer and man of the organization may justly be proud. So many
                  old members of the train, standing in ranks with wound chevrons at the last
                  review of the <a href="organizations.html#div42">Division</a>, was the finest
                  possible testimonial of work well done by you.

               relates truthfully, indiscriminately and as vividly as possible, the happenings
               which affected the lives of the members of the <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th

            </p>
            
            <p>The train was composed of eight companies from as many states. The staff
               consisted of enlisted men of all Medical Department ranks permissable in a
               sanitary train, 18 in number. The staff was selected by finding two alleged
               writers in each organization, choosing two others at large, and detailing them
               to write. The necessary authority and money was supplied by <a class="person" href="people.html#wsconkling"> Lieutenant Colonel Wilbur S. Conkling</a>, the
               commanding officer of the train. 
            </p>
            
            <p> The purpose of the book is to refresh the memories of the members of the train
               in after years, and to bring such pleasures as the memories may&#x2014;  "Forsan et haec olim meminisse juvabit."  In

               especially urged, to pour over its contents, because it might have no special
               interest to persons having no friends in the organization or not being otherwise
               concerned in the workings of a medical organization of a combat division.

               <div class="dropcap">T</div><span class="uppercase">he</span> story of the naming of the
               <a href="organizations.html#div42">42nd Infantry Division</a> is familiar to every
               American who read the newspapers or who gathered to discuss the status of the
               <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">United States</a> in regard to the Great
               European War and the extent to which we intended to enter the struggle, during
               the months which made up the summer and autumn of 1917. It is familiar because
               it concerned the first full National Guard Division to sail overseas and because
               this particular division represented many states of <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">the
                  Union</a> and every section of the country. It is familiar because
               it brought grim realization of the part the nation was to play by taking the
               "part time soldiers," the <a href="organizations.html#natguard">National Guards</a>,
               from more than 25,000 scattered homes.
            </p>
            
            <p>But the tale of how dough-boys of the division began to watch for their sign in
               the heavens, and how it really became to them the "bow of promise" on the
               battlefields of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> is a story which is not
               so well known. That, like all traditions, grew. It grew behind that curtain of
               censorship which kept <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">the enemy</a> unadvised
               of the torrent of men and munitions <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a>
               was speeding into <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>, and behind that
               curtain which likewise kept fond hearts at home from knowing just all that their
               boys were doing to free the world from a hateful system.
            </p>
            
            <p>As has been said, all traditions must grow, but likewise all traditions must have

            <p>Perhaps no spring has been more dreaded or awaited with more breathless
               expectancy than the spring of
               1918. All through the longest and most severe winter of the war ominous<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"omnious" [sic]</em></span></span> threats regarding the greatness of the storm that spring would bring

               <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>, <a class="place" href="places.html#enk">England</a> and <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a>. The vast
               Teutonic propaganda octopus was spouting ink from a thousand mouths. All sorts
               of rumors were afloat concerning the greatest of all offensives with which
               <a class="place" href="places.html#gw">Germany</a> hoped to finally crush all
               resistance of <a href="organizations.html#allies">the Allied powers</a>. Whispers were
               heard here and there of a new and irresistible<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"irressistible" [sic]</em></span></span> gas that would kill all before it. Insidious<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Insiduous" [sic]</em></span></span> tales were passed by word of mouth with the rapidity of lightning,
               apparently reaching all parts of the world simultaneously. Dame rumor was never
               less idle.

            <p>So the spring was dreaded because of new horrors it held in store. It was waited
               for because the <a href="organizations.html#aef">Americans</a> would be there in force
               to put their shoulders to the wheel and to lighten the grievous burden. It was
               hoped for because it would bring relief from the suffering of winter trench
               warfare.
            </p>
            
            <p>When warm showers and bright sunshine began to replace the blighting cold and
               rain and 1eaden skies, when warm breezes once more wafted downy white breakers
               across the blue sea of heaven and gently awoke the world, they found the
               <a href="organizations.html#div42">42nd American Division</a> holding a sector in
               the Vosges mountains, but a few hundred yards
               from the border of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>'s lost <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-lor">Lorraine</a>. The <a href="organizations.html#div42">Division</a> had been there since mid-winter, and war seemed to be a
               drab sort of catastrophe as viewed from these thinly held mountains with their
               occasional raids and minor battles, but continuous mud, snow and rain. 
            </p>
            
            <p>It was whispered about that an attack was to be made, as is always the case no
               matter how much secrecy is observed in preparations for the action. Those who
               were in support saw long, dim, creaking lines of artillery and ammunition come
               stealthily up the roads under cover of night and disappear before morning under
               natural and artificial camouflage. Before many days had passed every clump of
               trees in the rear area of the sector was bristling with guns and shells and men
               all waiting. Finally the day came and at the appointed hour all the masked guns
               leapt into action. For hours the air was filled with screeching<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"screaching" [sic]</em></span></span> steel. The earth trembled at the continued explosions that scratched
               and tore at its face with venomous<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"venemous" [sic]</em></span></span> claws. 
            </p>
            
            <p>With dawn there came the promise of a smiling sun after the drizzle of the long
               thunderous night. And with it  "H"  hour. Out of their crumbling sloppy
               trenches clambered the <a href="organizations.html#aef">doughboys</a> at the signal.
               They moved forward through openings in the tangled masses of barbed-wire and
               spread out behind the awesome curtain of the creeping barrage.
            </p>
            
            <p>Suddenly one of the bent-over, intent, jogging figures looked up and ahead and
               saw that the first rays of the rising sun had painted a rainbow across the
               receding clouds.  "Look!"  he shouted to his neighbor runner and somehow
               getting his attention above all the crash of artillery and sharp sputter of
               machine guns pointed to what he had seen.
            </p>
            
            <p>Odd as it may seem that such a commonplace thing as a rainbow would draw
               attention in the midst of such stern business, the word passed up and down the
               line of crouching runners and all took a moment to look. But the first line
               trench of <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">the enemy</a> was at hand. After a
               few moments of brisk hand-to-hand fight-

                  <div class="top-center">The Rainbow</div>
               </div>ing with the outposts left
               to hinder the raid, the line swept on toward the rainbow and the second and
               third defenses of <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">the enemy</a>. At last the
               mission of the attack was completed. Prisoners were taken, documents captured
               and fortifications leveled. So full of enthusiasm were the raiders, however,
               that it was with reluctance that they retraced their steps at the command. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Back again in their own trenches the story of the rainbow leading the attack was
               passed around. Before the end of the day it had been told and retold to every
               man in the Division.
            </p>
            
            <p>Spring had merged into summer. The mightiest effort of the <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">Hun hordes</a> was stemmed and the flood began to
               recede, slowly at first and then more and more quickly as confidence waned and
               the lines were thinned by the storms of steel. One day in
               late July the <a href="organizations.html#div42">Rainbow Division</a> was
               struggling through the Foret de Fere north of
               <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-cth">Chateau Thierry</a> and near that little
               stream, the Ourcq, which has written itself
               ineffaceably in the history of <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a>. For
               days it had been fighting against tremendous odds in those tangled woods and
               across those golden and red fields of wheat and poppies. By wild charge, by
               stealthy advance it had captured nests of machine gunners entrenched, or perched
               in trees. Against two  "invincible"  Prussian Guard divisions it had steadily
               advanced to the foot of <a class="place" href="places.html#hill212">Hill 212</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Here was the deadlock. Backward and forward the lines swayed as a height was
               taken or a village captured, lost and won again within the space of a few hours.
               <a class="place" href="places.html#hill212">Hill 212</a> was a strategic point and
               must be taken before the troops could advance and wipe out the threatening
               salient. Artillery was brought up and the attack planned. The hour came. As the
               tired waves of men began their leaping, falling, crawling, halting advance
               towards the crest, an astonishing phenomenon appeared. Clouds that had soaked
               the earth during the night parted, and across the wooded crest of the hill was
               brilliantly etched the Bow of Promise. It was a promise of Victory. The fighters
               forgot their fatigue horror and hardships of the past weeks. With a wild cheer
               they burst into a fierce charge.  "The Rainbow! The Rainbow!"  they shouted,
               and again the familiar  "Heaven, Hell or <a class="place" href="places.html#nju-hob">Hoboken</a> before Christmas."  All waves swept on and up in
               the face of showers of bullets and shrapnel<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"schrapnel" [sic]</em></span></span>, and they captured the heights without faltering. And again the story
               was told of how the battle-sky had held aloft the emblem of victory.
            </p>
            
            <p>In September the division moved up from a short rest
               to the  "<a class="place" href="places.html#fr-tou">Sector northwest of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-tou">Toul</a></a>"  by forced night marches. In a
               steady downpour of rain the troops splashed into the trenches on the

               towering height of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-mts">Mont Sec</a>, that fortress
               which cost <a href="organizations.html#fr-military">the French</a> so dearly to take
               and lose early in the war. 
            </p>
            
            <p>With the break of day,  "H"  hour struck and the <a href="organizations.html#armus">First
                  American Army</a> began its first independent offensive. Its purpose
               was to nip off the troublesome <a href="organizations.html#stms"><a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stm">St.
                     Mihiel</a> salient</a> that so long had thrust its nose

            </p>
            
            <p>Clumsy looking but, agile, little whippet tanks appeared here and there and
               crawled out nosing for trouble. The artillery that had been pounding away since
               midnight at German wire, front trenches communications, batteries, and back
               areas, now laid down its protective barrage and the brown lines of infantry
               spread out in ragged formation.
            </p>
            
            <p>By this time the story of how the rainbow came to lead the successful attacks of
               the division had become a cherished legend in the hearts of the <a href="organizations.html#aef">doughboys</a>. There was little promise of a rainbow to
               guide them that day for they had had no glimpse of the sun in more than two
               weeks of dreary, sloppy night marches. And the next day was to be Friday the 13th. The boys were depressed.
            </p>
            
            <p> But the sign came. As the first defenses were taken and the lines moved forward,
               snipping their way through acres of tangled barbed-wire and running from cover
               to cover toward the sheer sides of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-mts">Mont
                  Sec</a>, the sun broke through the clouds. Across the western horizon
               was flung in all its vivid colors the insignia of the fighting division. It was
               the good omen. The mountain was surrounded captured, and the march
               continued.
            </p>
            
            <p>No one has yet satisfactorily explained the last appearance of the colors in the
               sky before the signing of the armistice. It was just prior to the final phase of
               the <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-meu">Meuse</a> offensive. <a href="organizations.html#aef">The Americans</a> were waiting to burst across the Kriemhilde Stellung<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Kremhilde-Stellung" [sic]</em></span></span> onto the plains before <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-sed">Sedan</a> and
               to sever there the important lines of communication of <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">the enemy</a>. The whole division was at the time
               hiding in the rain-soaked, dripping Argonne
               forest, awaiting the word to advance to the forward
               positions.
            </p>
            
            <p>One morning the sun appeared and drove every cloud from the sky. It was one of
               those warm, clear autumn days of early October. In the course of the morning a
               great aeroplane circled lazily over the woods which hid the division· It was
               apparently aimlessly patrolling the sky. In its wake it left a long, sinuous
               streamer of white smoke which scarcely moved from the spot where it was left, so
               motionless was the air. And on this smoke a band of rainbow hues appeared.

            <p>There is very little that escapes the notice of a great concentration of troops
               that have nothing to do but stay hidden. It was not long until someone had spied
               out the colors. Within a few minutes 28,000 pairs of eyes had beheld the sign
               and lusty throats began to shout. It was the prevalent opinion that the
               appearance of the colors foretold that the division was to be called upon at
               once to come to grips with the <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">Boches</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Strangely enough all elements of the famous unit were in the lines within a week.
               Across the German stronghold, the Kremhilde-Stellung, the <a href="organizations.html#aef">Yankees</a>
               battled their way and won the great race to <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-sed">Sedan</a>. The official American communique stated on November 9th:
                "<a href="organizations.html#div42">The Rainbow Division</a> and units of
               <a href="organizations.html#div1">the First Division</a> have captured that
               part of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-sed">Sedan</a> lying on the west side of
               the Meuse and the heights overlooking
               the city." 
            </p>
            
            <p>Once more the rainbow made its appearance to the division. This time it was not
               before a battle nor during a battle. It was on the afternoon of the 16th of December, 1918, as <a href="organizations.html#div42">the Rainbow Division</a> completed the last lap of its memorable
               march to the Rhine. To the strains of
               martial music the tired columns of <a href="organizations.html#aef">doughboys</a>
               rounded the last curve in the valley of the
               Ahr and came within sight of the
               Rhine. Just then a magnificent rainbow spanned the valley from
               the ruins of <a class="place" href="places.html#dra-castle">Drachenfels castle</a> to the
               heights on the south side of the river. The war was won. The last objective had
               been reached and so appeared the emblem of success·
            </p>
            
            <p>The average American will tell you that he is not superstitious. But you would
               have a mighty hard time convincing any doughboy of <a href="organizations.html#div42">the
                  Rainbow Division</a> that the appearances of the emblem were mere
               coincidences. They were more than that he will tell you. They were omens of
               victory.
            </p>
            
            <p>But it is not of the division, as such, with which this history deals. It must
               treat of but one phase of its activities. It is of the blood-red ray of the bow
               that we would speak, of the red cross of mercy as borne on the fields of France
               by the <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Sanitary Train</a>. It is our purpose
               to give an accurate account of the formation, training and activities of the
               train as a whole and of each unit of it, to serve not as a contribution to
               literature but as a lasting record of events which might otherwise become
               blurred or effaced from our book of memory as years pass.

            <p>P<span class="uppercase">RIOR</span> to late August, 1917, it is
               doubtful if the coming events had cascast much shadow on a certain little
               <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-lon-city">Long Island City</a>, long
               sequestered from the rush and roar of modern American life. <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-hem">Hempstead Village</a>, as it was politically called,
               had existed only in so far as it occupied a place on the map,&#x2014;no less and
               little more. The residents seeming to be content to live and to let live,
               revered with true pride the rich blessings of Nature's choicest landscapes and
               the glory of time honored associations. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Indeed, the old colonial manner of life was preferred. It was like a trip into
               Yesterday, to stroll along the splendid avenues so magnificently shadowed by the
               stately elms and maples, or to drop into the historic little Episcopalian
               chapel, whose charter had been granted by <a class="person" href="people.html#queenanne">Queen
                  Anne</a>. One could almost see the early days of <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a>'s history, with the Indian encampments, where
               crafty redskins bartered in wampum, hides, furs and feathers. Had <a class="person" href="people.html#pstuyvesant">Peter Stuyvesant</a>, himself, stumped
               cholerically down a street there, no one would have been greatly surprised. Such
               was <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-hem">Hempstead Village</a> in early August, 1917. It
               is very doubtful if many people other than New Yorkers had ever previously heard
               of the place, or of <a class="place" href="places.html#campmills">Camp Albert L.
                  Mills</a>, the official designation of the tract of land nearby,
               destined to become a great national mobilization point. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Then somebody suddenly realized that there was a war on hand. The newspapers had
               been conveying the intelligence for several months, but to all appearances
               <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-hem">Hempstead</a> was but mildly interested in
               the coming of her guests. No sooner had a few <a href="organizations.html#aef">O. D.
                  men</a> investigated the possibilities of the great camp site on the
               <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-hem">Hempstead Downs</a>, however, than
               hundreds of <a href="organizations.html#natguard">National Guardsmen</a>, the first
               elements of the <a href="organizations.html#div42">42nd Infantry Division</a>, began to
               gather in the village and camp. Gradually, day by day, and hour by hour, was
               assembled the first complete, fully equipped National Guard Division in the
               nation's history. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The rough spots in the <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-nas">Nassau County</a> roads
               soon became polished under the tramp of marching feet; the bray of the Army mule
               vied with the song of the meadow-lark, the crow, and the bugle, to sound the
               spirit of the crisp autumnal mornings; the heavy, ponderous combat wagons
               rumbled along the turnpikes,

                of the <a href="organizations.html#armus">U. S. Army</a> made the color
               prespective to civilian eyes a veritable blur of olive-drab; the honk of the
               General's Klaxon and the bawl of the jitney drivers made the path of the
               pedestrian beset with peril. The theatres were jammed, the merchants waxed fat
               on spot cash sales, the traction system never knew such prosperity,&#x2014;in
               short, <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-hem">Hempstead</a> awoke from its Rip Van

            <p> No microscope was necessary to analyze the colors present in the military
               spectrum. Infantry blue and artillery red, engineer cardinal and the maroon of
               the medical department were readily discernable in the riot of activity and
               color which prevailed on every hand. To form these maroon rays, eight companies
               had been assembled from the length and breadth of land. In the response to
               <a class="person" href="people.html#wwilson">the President</a>'s call to arms, <a class="place" href="places.html#nju">New Jersey</a>'s sons carried her spirit in <a href="organizations.html#comnju">the 165th</a>; <a class="place" href="places.html#tnu">Tennessee</a>'s gift from the southland was <a href="organizations.html#comtnu">the 166th</a>; <a class="place" href="places.html#oku">Oklahoma</a>'s offering

               contributed of her <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Wolverines</a>, <a href="organizations.html#commiu">the 168th</a>. These were the <a href="organizations.html#secam">Ambulance companies</a>. The no less essential <a href="organizations.html#secfh">Field Hospitals</a>, bearing corresponding numbers, were composed of
               units from <a class="place" href="places.html#dcu">the white capitol of the Nation</a>,
               from the wide prairies of <a class="place" href="places.html#neu">Nebraska</a>, from the

               from the shadow of <a class="place" href="places.html#cou">Colorado</a>'s snow-covered
               peaks.
            </p>
            
            <p> Toward this rendezvous on <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-lon">Long Island</a>
               there had steamed forth into the rising sun long trains packed from end to end
               with boisterous youths and eager men with shining eyes and light hearts setting
               out on this great adventure. Thus were assembled the rays of the division's
               sanitary train, which, so far as localities were represented, might as well have
               been called Rainbow as might the larger units, the division.

            <p> Under the command of <a class="person" href="people.html#hjbryson">Major Herbert J.

                  hospital company</a> arrived in <a class="place" href="places.html#campmills">Camp
                  Mills</a>. This was on the morning of August
               20. In order that the sick and emergency cases in the units coming in
               hourly, might be properly cared for, this company immediately pitched a 120-bed
               field hospital at the main entrance near the <a class="place" href="places.html#clintonroad">Clinton Road</a>. Owing to the pressing needs for more room, to
               centralize the incoming regiments, the company was moved from its first position
               to the permanent site near the  ""back way to camp.""  Here

               under <a class="person" href="people.html#paperkins">Captain Percy A. Perkins</a>, camped
               alongside on September 1.
               The following day
               <a href="organizations.html#comoku">Oklahoma Ambulance company</a> reached camp with

            <p>No commanding officer, whose sole duty was primarily to center in the work of the
               two sections had been provided for in this initial assemblage of the train. That

               ambulance and field hospital sections were the common purpose of caring for the

            <p>Despite the steady downpours of rain during those early September days, as soon as each unit was
               established an exhaustive series of exercises, drills, hikes, and lectures were
               taken up. Nothing that was at that time considered essential to the maximum
               efficiency of the trained medical men, was left untouched. The

               everything from first-aid in all practical forms and infantry drill to litter
               drills, ward, pryamidal and shelter tent pitching, calesthenics, sanitation, the
               care and use of the equipment and including the why and wherefore of the new
               medical belt. It seemed to the men as though no hour of the day was left vacant.
               Espseially was this true with the ambulance companies, who were thoroughly
               inspired with the idea that an ambulance man must be part doctor, part chauffeur
               and part soldier.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Saturday morning inspections were minute and thorough. Preparations for such
               usually began on Friday afternoons when every bit of debris was carefully
               interred or disposed of, the ground raked, scoured and swept and the equipment
               shined and cleaned until the vicinity ot the sanitary train gounds radiated like
               the rainbow itself. Three times a week all the tents were furled in order that
               the air might circulate freely and at least partly evaporate the numbing
               dampness of the enclosures
            </p>
            
            <p>The sanitary methods in vogue around the train camp site were of the best. Any
               hour of the day or night a man might take a cold shower bath in the tapestried
               enclosures at the end of the respective streets. Rigid daily inspections were
               made to ensure<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"insure" [sic]</em></span></span> model spotless kitchens which were completely screened to keep out the
               flies. Running water was at hand just outside the door. All garbage was either
               buried or burned in makeshift incinerators nearby. Hence the general health of
               the sanitary train being constantly safeguarded, the number of men answering
               sick call was very small. A slight indisposition for a day or so after the
               injection of typhoid and paratyphoid prophylaxsis was not considered as
               illness.

                  formerly in use on the border was called in and new stuff was

                The rusty old round canteen, the rubber poncho, the bolo or corps knife,
               old style haversack, leather belt, corps pouch and non-comm's medical case went
               into the discard. In their place the "U" roll came into favor along with
               hatchets, individual medical pouch belts, a canteen and cup shaped to fit the
               hip and various other "improvements." Alas, for the medical belt; its use has
               always mroe theoretical than practical. The bandages stuck together like glue
               and a week's sojourn in the tents so mildewed their medication that they soon
               became useless. It was next to impossible to remove them from their tight
               pockets. As for the hatchet, not a man breathes who had been dodging shells and

               drivers who, in the cramped space at their disposal in the car, had practically
               no room in which to groan, much less to wear the things. The <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Sanitary Train</a> endured that girdle throughout
               the war and the armistice, and not a word of praise has yet been uttered in
               extenuation of the army medical belt.

            <p> Inroads on the numbers of the personnel, as deemed expedient in the modern
               scheme of war, early manifested themselves. Instead of the man being cemented to
               his unit as in previous crises, he was frequently automatically severed from his
               affiliations and sent to school, transferred to another company, or sent away on
               special duty.

               her personnel was cut to a working force of 122 men. This was necessary, in as
               much as the company had just become motorized. The surplus men, representing the
               difference between a motor and an animal-drawn outfit, were distributed over the
               train as well as incorporated in the medical detachment of the <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Engineers</a>.

               surgical operations with but two deaths in addition to innoculating and

            <p>The army mule was directly responslble for the war-time destinies of a
               considerable number of the men in the sanitary train, when on October 7 a special detail of seven men each from

Joseph J. Nabhan</a> of <a href="organizations.html#comoku">Oklahoma</a> left for a southern port to superintend the general
               welfare and embarkation of the mules of the animal-drawn outfits. What was
               supposed to be a lark, and prior service overseas, developed into a prolonged
               and dismal sojourn in <a class="place" href="places.html#va-new">Newport News</a> stables,
               pictorially rather than aromatically known as  "Remount

               divisional units to pass the reviewing stand on the <a class="place" href="places.html#clintonroad">Clinton Road</a>. Despite the soldierly precision
               of movement and formation, the personnel was far from being in a sunny mood.
               They had previously stood in line for more than three hours on a very dusty
               road, during which time a stream of traffic had constantly passed, thereby
               making the men more like dusty millers in white than soldiers of the legion. But
               it was all in the game and that afternoon the men polished up anew and were
               toasting marshmallows by the genial firesides all over the island, and in
               <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu">New York</a>.

            <p>The nature of much of the drilling made it more play than work. Leap frog, crack
               the whip, dashes and tug of war were entered into with as characteristic good
               nature and grim determinationn as though thesoilders<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"soldier" [sic]</em></span></span> were bucking the football line. Nor were the lectures at all hard to
               take, as they were replete with information on subjects of general interest. The
               men learned the ins and outs of the 
               <a href="http://suvcw.org/education/documents/articles.htm">Articles of
                  War</a>
                and military courtesy, the difference between an acid and a corrosive
               poison, the why of a <a class="person" href="people.html#hford">Ford</a> ambulance part, how
               to stack a litter, the proper bearing of a soldier, when speech was to be silver
               and silence golden, and incidentally how to behave in a French billet. The men
               were led to believe that, although things would be somewhat different overseas,
               their quarters were to be choice, commodious and comfortable&#x2014;a home away
               from home. The subject of cooties, bleak and frigid barns, and fragrant manure
               piles so dear to the heart of the French villagers, was avoided. It was taken
               for granted that experience and self-reliance would be the best teacher when the
               time came. If at times the meat in the lectures grew at all dry, the men never
               tired to watch the intrepid airmen overhead. To most of the personnel such
               exhibitions were something new, as one or two at a time were all that had been
               visible in the life lived before.
            </p>
            
            <p>Many were the diversions in the ritual of the encampment as the weeks slipped by.
               Baseball claimed the attention of ardent players and a dozen fast, snappy games
               were played. An attempt to organize a league was made, but, owing to the lack of
               athletes in several units, and the short time at the train's disposal, only a
               few inter-company games were staged. An exhibition game between the <a href="organizations.html#teamnyg">New York Giants</a> and <a href="organizations.html#teamcws">Chicago
                  White Sox</a> players, at <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-gar">Garden
                  City</a>, was a treat for the train members to see.

            <p>A pay day arrived one Sunday, with its attendant shirt-tail parade around camp in
               the gloaming, to the martial music of questionable bugles enlivened by fire

            <p>the shooting up of the Robbers' Row of canteens. It was all as spectacularly
               staged as in the wild and wooly days of 1849. A storm
               second to none from the standpoint of fury didn't lessen the dampness of the
               island in the least, and the sanitary train will never forget that night of
               October 12 when the hurricane-like squall
               descended and made the campsite more like a Venetian city than dry land.
            </p>
            
            <p>Ever a source of pleasure to the men of the train was the gracious hospitality of
               the <a href="organizations.html#pplli">Long Islanders</a> who extended every courtesy
               within their power to make the soldiers feel at home. On Saturday afternoons and

               became the meccas of attractions for a large percentage of the medical men. Such
               cordiality was better felt than expressed. It is more than probable that it was
               in the spacious reception parlors of the <a href="organizations.html#redcross">American Red
                  Cross</a> in <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-hem">Hempstead</a> that many
               of the men partook of the last slice of honest to goodness cake ever tasted
               until their European experiences were lived and ended.
            </p>
            
            <p>Sundays were quiet days in camp as the men were usually out to dinner, in quest
               of various and sundry amusements, or enjoying 24 hours of freedom in <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu">New York City</a>. What had been but a tale or a
               descriptive article in the popular magazine or book a few months before became a
               sparkling reality as the soldiers saw the sights and the attractions of that
               great metropolis.

            <p>The experiences encountered during such pilgrimages will long loiter in the minds

            <p>As West mixed with East, in mercenary ways and customs, many amusing incidents
               arose which, while binding the ties, nevertheless amused members of the sanitary
               train, greatly. One youthful medical soldier related that he was addressed by a

               confectionery store as follows:

               that wild west stage money passed for real U. S. Greenbacks over more than one
               counter in Robbers' Row. Considering the exhorbitant prices extracted from the
               soldiers' pockets for commodities, some considered it a good way to get
               even.
            </p>
            
            <p><a class="place" href="places.html#campmills">Camp Mills</a> was ever and anon a sea of
               rumors. Nothing seemed too wild or increditable for the soldierly appetite. For
               a time the sugar-coated information perculated through the usual channels, that
               the <a href="organizations.html#div42">Rainbow Division</a> had been recently inspected
               by a  "Lieut. Gen. Mogull"  and found unfit for foreign
               servie. Furthermore, as a result of his findings, the sanitary train was to be
               sent south, probably to <a class="place" href="places.html#cu">Cuba</a>, to train for the
               winter. There was no mistaking the ultimate destination of the train, when on
               September 20, <a class="person" href="people.html#wpchalfant">Lt.
                  William P. Chalfant</a> of <a href="organizations.html#comnju">New
                  Jersey</a>, sailed for <a class="place" href="places.html#nju">New Jersey</a>,
               sailed for <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> with the division's advance
               party. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Yet the men forgot that fact two days later when <a class="place" href="places.html#gw">Germany</a> and <a class="place" href="places.html#au">Austria</a> staged one
               of their celebrated fake pleas for peace. The men accepted it at face value with
               a howl of joy which swept through the camp like a chip on a flood tide's crest.
               Next the <a href="organizations.html#unkqm">Q. M.</a> sergeants began to mark boxes of
               supplies  "Arizona."  The busybodies didn't stop to consider
               that such was a code word to fool Hun spies, but immediately began to enlarge
               the idea that the division was due for Border service. Visions of sand fleas,
               scorpions, rattlesnakes, heat, dust and abominations of that arid region didn't
               cheer the men's spirits in the least; for with the exception of <a href="organizations.html#comoru">Oregon</a>, all the units had endured such a life the
               previous winter. Eventually, however, when the letters A. E. F. were added,
               foolishness took on a more somber tone. Belief and spread of these harmless
               rumors really served as a sort of patriotic camouflage to the facts in the case,
               in as much as the men were busy with foolishness when they might have been
               jabbering on dangerous facts. They obscured the positive order that <a href="organizations.html#div42">the Rainbow</a> was preparing as rapidly as possible for
               that mysterious country,  "Somewhere in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>." 
            </p>
            
            <p>Towards the middle of October, a certain definite
               belief that the division was about to move, took hold of the members of the
               train. A second physical examination was given with special emphasis directed
               towards sound hearts and lungs. A few physical defectives were eliminated from
               the personnel by this examination. Some of them had already registered for the
               selective draft and were subsequently inducted into the service again. <a class="person" href="people.html#wsshaw">William S. Shaw</a> of <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraska</a> was later drafted and died of Spanish Influenza at

            <p>Officer's trunks and barracks were crammed with extra clothing, shoes and little
               luxuries to cheer the residents overseas. Cots were stacked in the kitchen. The
               substantial long overcoats with their silken linings were exchanged for the
               short flimsy kind, about as warm as B. V. D.'s on a January night, a last
               strenuous inspection held, and the numbers of berths aboard a transport, doled
               out. When the men were finally confined to their company streets and not even
               pemitted to roam over to Robber's Row to put a dessert on dinner, something was
               undoubtedly in the air. Postcards to be mailed by the government,  "Private A. Yank, at last arrived safely over there,"  were
               written and handed to the proper custodian. Some of these cards were actually
               delivered.

            <p>During the midnight hours of October 17 and the morning of the
               18th, the sanitary troops, unit by unit, slipped out of camp as
               inconspicuously as possible to entrain for overseas. What the next lap of the
               quest would have in store, not a soul felt like predicting. Enough was it, that
               a new brand of warfare hovered in the offing.

               <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Sanitary Train</a>, deserted except for a
               lone guard here and there. Company streets had been thoroughly policed and
               raked, fires smoldered<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"smouldered" [sic]</em></span></span> in the incinerators where the camp debris had been burned the night
               before, and pyramidal tents were still standing with flaps closely tied. To the
               innocent civilian, all appearances would lead to the belief that an early
               morning hike was in progress. It was ; but a much longer hike than one so
               innocent would suspect. The train and the <a href="organizations.html#div42">Rainbow

            <p>There were no bands playing as, with full equipment the personnel of the eight
               companies marched quietly out at the main entrance of <a class="place" href="places.html#campmills">Camp Mills</a>, casting silent good-byes to those
               who watched them pass, and entrained at <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-gar">Garden

               accompanied by words of cheer.

            <p>Over at the docks in <a class="place" href="places.htmlnju-hob">Hoboken, N. J.</a>, were
               seven ships, awaiting the arrival of a cargo new to them. They were all old
               vessels, having seen service before the war with the Hamburg-American Line. But
               as they had been Hun property, they had been interned by the <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">United States</a> in the early stages of the European war
               under articles of International Law. When hostilities opened between the
               <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">United States</a> and <a class="place" href="places.html#gw">Germany</a>, the ships were seized and converted into transports.
               Repairs were made and the necessary remodeling was done, but at that, they were
               in poor condition and their American crews were kept busy repairing one thing or
               another during the entire voyage. The names of these German freighters were
               changed for patriotic American names which were: " "Covington," 
                "President Lincoln," 
                "President Grant," 
                "Mt. Vernon," 
                "Pastores," 
                "Tendores"  and  "De Kalb."  More than 27,000 officers and men were to be
               divided among these seven transports. The escort consisted of the cruiser
               "Seattle" and two destroyers, making ten ships in all in the Rainbow fleet. Two
               of the transports, the  "President Lincoln"  and the  "Covington,"  were
               submarined on later voyages while returning empty to <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a>.

               before by the cooks, were devoured while parting glances were cast at <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-nyc">New York City</a>. Darkness had fallen before all the
               troops had climbed the gang plank and been assigned to compartments. Many had
               anticipated palace-like staterooms with stewards in attendance, but such
               airecastles were demolished when ship officers led the way across the gun deck
               and down innumerable ladders, into the hold, one or two decks below the water
               line.
            </p>
            
            <p>It did not take long, however, for everyone to settle down to circumstances.
               After squeezing and maneuvering through the narrow passages between the
               three-tier canvas bunks, packs were disposed of by hanging them on water pipes
               and similar furnishings. True soldiers were the men of the sanitary train, so as
               soon as the doors of the mess halls were opened there was a grand rush.
               Appetites were keen for it had taken the entire day to get aboard, and breakfast
               had been a pre-daylight affair. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Not all of the train was assigned to the same transport. The "Covington," with
               <a class="person" href="people.html#wamann">Major General Mann</a>, commander of the
               <a href="organizations.html#div42">42nd division</a>, and his staff on board,

C.</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comoru">Oregon</a> and
               <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a> Field hospital companies. The

                  Section Headquarters</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comnju">New Jersey</a>,

               <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraska Field hospital</a>. <a href="organizations.html#comoku">Oklahoma</a> was assigned to the "President Lincoln"
               while <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Michigan</a> took a compartment on the
               "Pastores," formerly a <a href="organizations.html#unitedfruit">United Fruit
                  Company</a>'s freighter, which still oozed with the odors of South
               American bananas it had carried.
            </p>
            
            <p>As fast as the transports were loaded they were towed into the channel, slowly
               making their way out past the <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-sol">Statue of
                  Liberty</a> to Sandy Hook. Many
               eyes were peering through port holes and hatchways and many minds were wondering
                "how long?"  when the ships glided silently past the illuminated statue.
               Some even went without supper to take that parting glance and M. P.'s showed a
               soft spot in their hearts by allowing a few to stand on deck during these last
               precious minutes of fast gathering darkness over the homeland.

            <p>Everyone was tired and sleepy after the strain of the first day was over. No time
               was lost in making regulation beds on the narrow and short canvass bunks. The
               bunks were about the same on all the transports, being in tiers of three, with
               only a scant eighteen inches between them. The third story man had the advantage
               inasmuch as he was on top. Those having life belts

                "Take your feet out of my face, will you!"  or  "Say, Buck, will you remove your toe from my ear?" 
            </p>
            
            <p>At three o'clock on the morning of October
               19, anchors were weighed and the seven transports began their voyage
               towards <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>. Only a few were awakened by the
               clank of the anchor chains and the chugging of the engines. When the ship's
               electrician turned on the lights in the hold, announcing that the sun was up
               outside, and the familiar  "Heave to, and lash 'em up"  brought
               the sleepers to consciousness, the ships were steadily rolling, and those who
               rushed up the hatchway to the deck, saw nothing but the green water of the
               Atlantic and the rising sun. The first
               man on deck  "braced"  a hard looking sailor with the inevitable
               question:
            </p>
            
            
            <div class="line"> "How far are we from land?" </div>
            
            <div class="line"> "Three miles,"  was the reply.</div>
            
            <div class="line"> "Which direction?" </div>
            
            <div class="line"> "Straight down." </div>
            
            
            <p>Deck space was limited and the soldiers were plentiful. Each ship carried about
               two regiments. So each organization was allowed to go on deck at certain
               specified hours during the day, according to a schedule worked out by the
               ranking officers on the various ships. The average for an organization was two
               hours out of every twenty-four, but there were many who systematically worked
               out methods of staying up most of the time. Some even slept on the upper decks,
               perhaps feeling safer there than three flights down.
            </p>
            
            <p>Ventilation in the hold was a difficult problem, as the ships were originally
               designed for freighters and were never meant to foster life below the first deck
               down, where the crew slept. The regular ventilating systems of the ships were
               ample for the first deck with its lounging rooms, mess halls and seamen's
               quarters, but the compartments below the water line were airtight and dark, and
               those next to the engine rooms were hot as ovens. Auxiliary canvas ventilators
               were rigged up but even then it was stuffy and hot and many of the men lay on
               their bunks during the long evenings and nights, in the uniforms issued by
               Mother Nature. Owing to the bad air and crowded conditions, a ban on smoking in
               the steerage compartments at any time was put on after the first night.
            </p>
            
            <p>Days and nights passed very slowly, especially the night, for lights were turned

               </div> smoking was
               prohibited on deck after dark, leaving nothing for the soldiers to do but sleep.
               These were necessary precautions for the protection of the men. On the second
               day out, all matches, flashlights, and lighters were collected by the company
               officers to make certain the orders were obeyed in regard to smoking. A thousand
               or more glowing ends of cigarettes and cigars would make a splendid target for a
               "U" boat.

            <p>Peculiar ailments in the regions of the digestive organs began to appear among
               the train members on the second day at sea. A few took refuge on their bunks and
               in one or two cases, scarcely ever left them. The odor of "slum" and other foods
               in the mess halls made those places the chief scenes of disorder. The sufferers
               were a sorry lot and to some a torpedo from a German sub would have been
               welcomed. All in all, they became firm believers that <a class="person" href="people.html#ccolumbus">Columbus</a> was a brave man and shook hands with themselves for not
               enlisting in the navy. Most of the cases obtained their sealegs and recovered
               rapidly while a few were unable to appreciate life throughout the entire voyage. 
            </p>
            
            <p>A good example of <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">Hun</a> efficiency came to
               light the third day out, when the  "President Grant"  developed boiler
               trouble and began to lag behind. Even though all boats had been pronounced
               seaworthy after their trial trip, some clever German engineer had removed a
               minor part, calculated to disable the ship in midocean. On the evening of the
               fourth day, it was finally decided that the "Grant" was unable to run the danger
               zone, so with a good-bye toot of her whistle, she turned her prow towards
               <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu">New York</a>, taking <a href="organizations.html#secam">Ambulance section Headquarters</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comnju">New
                  Jersey</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comtnu">Tennessee</a> and <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraska</a> with her. 
            </p>
            
            <p>It was a great disappointment to these members of the <a href="organizations.html#st117">sanitary train</a>, for visions of <a class="place" href="places.html#e">Europe</a> and the battle fields were temporarily shattered and the
               train was scattered for the first time since its organization. The  "Grant" 
               docked at <a class="place" href="places.html#nju-hob">Hoboken</a> on the afternoon of
               October 27, and the troops were sent to neighboring camps to await
               their second attempt to cross. 
            </p>
            
            <p> "Abandon ship"  drills were inaugurated early in the trip.
               Orders required each man to carry a blanket and a canteen full of water besides
               wearing his overcoat and life preserver, when attending these drills.
               Instructions were issued in detail about what to do if the ship was actually
               abandoned. Everyone was assigned to either a life boat or a raft. Rafts were
               plentiful and were set apart for the use of enlisted men. Each company was
               assigned a spot on the gun deck, and whenever the alarm sounded, every man went
               to his company's rendezvous promptly, taking pains neither to hurry nor to
               loiter on his way. Nobody ever knew when the alarm sounded whether it was
               genuine or only a 
               <div type="facsimile">

               missing his raft. If he ran he was subject to being shot for starting a
               stampede. Consequently these drills were carried out with good speed and
               precision. Excitement ran high at such times, for imagination works strongly and
               it was always a relief when orders were given to return to the compartments. Not
               until then did any of the men know it was only a drill and during those short
               moments, often with rain and waves sweeping the decks, all eyes were searching
               the white-capped waves for periscopes.
            </p>
            
            <p>At first life belts were only to be kept handy, but after the danger zone was
               entered they had to be worn or carried at all times.  "Abandon
               ship"  drills came any hour of the day or night when least expected, and
               sometimes twice or three times a day. Drills were not held while the convoy was
               running the danger zone. In the moments of relaxation after the drills
               conversation always ran high. One could hear on all sides remarks about
               submarines, torpedoes, life belts, blankets, and various statements as to what
               should be done in case the ship was torpedoed. Everybody wanted a boat instead
               of a raft, for rafts were flimsy looking affairs and their occupants would be
               waist deep in cold water. General opinion changed, however, for on an occasion
               when the boats were lowered, the bottom fell out of one, the two sailors in
               charge being saved by their swimming ability. The incident was one more example
               of the subtle deviltry of the Hun. The boat had been put together with nothing
               but glue. Following the event all of the boats and rafts were subjected to a
               rigid inspection. The drills came to naught and the boats and rafts were never
               used ; thanks to the good work of the navy. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The cruiser and two destroyers were not the only protection the convoy had
               against the stealthy submarine. Each transport was armed with one or more
               six-inch guns and also with a few of smaller calibre. The guns were manned by
               experienced crews taken from battleships. Even experienced as they were, target
               practice was necessary in order that the gunners might be able to deal properly
               with a sub if one made an appearance. A moving target, towed behind one of the
               ships, and resembling a periscope, was used. The transports took their turns
               firing and after these performances the men's fears somewhat subsided. Many
               direct hits were scored and there were few shots that went wild. Keeping the
               guns trained on the target in a rolling sea as those gunners did, was a
               wonderful feat in itself. The practice was a rare sight to the soldiers for it
               gave them an idea of war on the sea, especially when a cruiser fired a
               broadside. Of the transports, the  "De Kalb"  was the most heavily armed,
               carrying in all twenty-six guns.

            <p>Life on the ocean was not without work or amusement. Washrooms, troop
               compartments and mess halls had to be cleaned every day by details selected from
               the personnel of the various organizations. <a href="organizations.html#unkkp">K.
                  P.</a>'s were not forgotten and a few enjoyed a sojourn in the
               kitchens with the navy cooks. The navy medical personnel on one or two of the
               transports was insufficient to care for both sailors and soldiers, so the train
               furnished some of its more experienced wielders of the iodine swab to assist in
               the sick bay. This was looked upon, more or less, as a  "soft
               job"  for the red cross arm band permitted them to go to any part of the
               vessel at any time. It was also a known fact that the sick bay was the only
               place on board where a real thirst-quenching drink of water could be obtained. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Time was heavy on the soldier's hands and he was thrown almost entirely on his
               own resources for amusement. Whenever the weather permitted, band concerts were
               held on the main deck, but these only occupied a short hour of the day.
               Impromptu programs were sometimes given in the evenings. Every available book,
               magazine and paper was carefully read by the pale blue light of the hold. Those
               who were not inclined, or were not lucky enough to have something to read,
               played cards, shot craps, or discussed the prospects held in store by the war.
               Some of the more energetic, burled themselves in French grammars and hand books,
               so that they would be able to  "parlez vous" 
               when the voyage was finally ended and they were on solid ground again. Curiosity
               led many of the bolder characters to explore the ship, visiting the many
               compartments, store rooms and even gaining entrance to the engine rooms. When
               nothing else could be done, the men lay on their bunks and slept. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The two hours of breathing time on deck were taken up by attempts to run the
               canteen line&#x2014;a feat rarely accomplished&#x2014;dodging the spray, making up
               for lost smokes, and above all, searching the waves as far as the eye could see
               for submarines or other vessels. Whenever a strange ship made an appearance, the
               destroyers immediately investigated, and once when all guns were leveled on a
               mysterious boat, everyone was on edge for  "something doin'"  until the
               competent chasers signaled that all was well. Especially after the danger zone
               was entered were all eyes strained for the sight of a periscope or the white
               wake of an on-coming torpedo, but never were the searching glances rewarded. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Day after day went by with no signs of ever getting anywhere. All there was to be

            <p>be sighted? Rumor had it that a large escort was to relieve the original one
               which the men deemed inadequate. Every day someone heard that the convoy was to
               join the fleet that night. Every morning coming on deck, all would look for the
               missing destroyers. Fear began to spread that <a href="organizations.html#div42">the
                  Rainbow</a> had been forgotten and would have to face the dangers with
               very little protection. The suddenly one morning, after all hope had been cast
               overboard, the fleet was surrounded by eleven mysterious and grotesquely painted
               crafts. They darted in and out, here and there, seemingly leaving no spot
               uncovered in their nervous plungings. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Here was a new diversion, for the ocean-weary soldiers, watching the pitching,
               rolling, wildly daubed destroyers patrolling the sea. This was the first time
               the men ever saw camouflage. Their arrival was soon accounted for when a
                "sailor told a soldier"  that during the previous night, the fleet had
               almost run into a submarine nest, only being warned in time to change its
               course, while the two destroyers gave chase.
            </p>
            
            <p>The feeling that land was not far away began to take hold of the troops and
               visions of Sunny <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> occupied their
               imagination. Obliging sailors put out the information that the fleet was in the
               Bay<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"bay" [sic]</em></span></span> of Biscay and would soon be in sight of land. Much
               wreckage, a life boat, several rafts and boxes were seen afloat. Seagoing
               vessels could be sighted in the distance, gulls swarmed about the transports and
               a general cleaning and inspection of troops' quarters took place. Still the
               once-clean but now filthy life belts had to be worn at all times for it was said
               that this was the most dangerous water of all that the fleet had passed over. 
            </p>
            
            <p>On the morning of October 31, word was passed
               below that land was in sight. In a few minutes the decks were crowded and heads
               were protruding from every port hole, drinking in the welcome sight of Belle Isle. Everyone drew in a deep sigh of relief
               as the fleet passed through the submarine nets between the mainland of
               <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> and Belle
               Isle. Life belts were thrown aside, and one by one the transports
               entered the channel of the Loire River<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"river" [sic]</em></span></span>. Thousands of small fishing boats dotted the water on
               all sides. The channel was shallow and all the transports were heavily loaded,
               so very little headway was made during the day, even with French pilots on
               board. This only aggravated the already impatient men who were anxious to bid
               farewell to transports and set foot on good hard ground once more.

            <p>At 3 o'clock on the morning of November 1,

               ocean voyage has often been vaunted but no description ever written can
               adequately portray the way it looked to the members of the <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Sanitary Train</a>, as they gazed upon it from the decks of the
               boats in which they had crossed the ocean. The land they saw was not dry,
               either, for everywhere within vision was mud, and what they could not see was
               hidden by the fog and mist that hung over the harbor at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stn">St. Nazaire</a> on the morning of the first of November,
               1917. As has been told in the previous Chapter the last fourteen days
               had been spent on the water, and the last four days in the zone of great U-boat
               activity. The relief at finding themselves in the harbor, safe and sound was far
               more luxurious feeling than the peace time traveler experiences even after his
               first voyage. Every one of the men had heard and read a great deal about  "Sunny <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>" , and
               although it was far from sunny that morning, they were glad to see it just the
               same. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The entire day was spent on the boats, and from the decks the men had their first
               glimpse of <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">the Boche</a>,&#x2014;a harmless,
               domesticated type, commonly known <a href="organizations.html#gw-pg">P.G.'s</a>. They
               were doing longshore work on the dock, unloading supplies belonging to the
               <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">U. S. A.</a>, and every box they handled was
               bringing the German defeat just so much closer. In charge of the entire group of
               about fifty, was one French guard, and he was much more interested in watching
               the masses of O. D. clad soldiers over the rails of the transports, than in
               keeping check on his prisoners. 
            </p>
            
            <p>This guard was the first man seen wearing the horizon blue of the French, so
               familiar to every member of the <a href="organizations.html#aef">A. E. F.</a> To the
               men on the boats he was representative of the millions of brave Frenchmen, who
               had fought, and were still fighting, for Right against a foe as merciless and
               cunning as a famished wolf pack. He was one of the men whom they had crossed the
               ocean to help; and they were glad they had come. 
            </p>
            
            <p>In another place on the dock was a group of American negroes in the overall
               uniform of the stevedores. They seemed to be enjoying life just as much as if
               they had been on some Dixie wharf, handling cotton bales instead of unloading
               munitions of war in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>.

            <p>Here and there were stern looking American <a href="organizations.html#marus">Marines</a> doing general guard duty on the dock.  "Hard boiled"  was the word the boys employed in describing them. 
            </p>
            
            <p>As soon as the civilian population of the city became aware that a new convoy of
               <a href="organizations.html#pplus">Americans</a> had arrived, they flocked to the
               water front. These were not the first <a href="organizations.html#pplus">Yanks</a> they
               had seen, but the appearance of these boats, swarming with strong, sturdy, young
               soldiers from a far-off land, arriving safely from a sea infested with German
               U-boats, had not ceased to thrill and interest them. The men on the boats were
               interested in the civilians, too, because they wanted to see and know more about
               the people whom they had come so far to help. The most noticeable thing about
               the crowd was the almost total absence of able-bodied men. The few who were
               there were in uniform. The remainder of the crowd consisted of old men, women
               and children. The women were all dressed in black, and many of the men wore
               mourning bands on their arms. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The water around the transports was crowded with small boats, loaded with
               children, who begged souvenirs, and offered chocolate and apples for sale, and
               many a service hat was lowered by means of a cord or rope, filled with many
               apples or as much chocolate as the money in the hat would buy, and hauled back
               up into the porthole. 
            </p>
            
            <p>When evening came the impressions of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> in
               the minds of the soldiers were strange and varied, but as they lay down on their
               canvass bunks that night, every man was glad that he was there and proud to
               think that he had volunteered to come. 
            </p>
            
            <p>On the morning of the 2nd of November, <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Michigan</a> debarked from their boat and, leaving a
               detail behind to take care of the company equipment as it was unloaded, they
               marched through the city and out to what was known as <a class="place" href="places.html#camp1">Camp No. 1</a>, their first home in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>. This camp was composed of French wooden barracks and
               furnished shelter for approximately 1500 men. It was used for housing men who
               came off the boats until transportation could be obtained to carry them inland.
               Here the men had a chance to get rid of their sea legs, to bathe the salt crust
               off their bodies, to wash their clothes, to replenish their supply of tobacco
               and cigarettes and learn to count in francs and centimes. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The same day, a detail was chosen to proceed inland and arrange for billets in
               the towns where the train was to make its first home in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>. One non-commissioned officer from each company formed
               this advance party, in charge of <a class="person" href="people.html#rccook">Captain Robert C.
                  Cook</a> of <a href="organizations.html#comcou"><a class="place" href="places.html#cou">Colorado</a>.</a></p>

               <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a> were taken off the boat at
               different times during the day, marched through the city to <a class="place" href="places.htmlfr-oblvd">Ocean Boulevard</a> and there given a few minutes'
               freedom for the purpose of stretching and exercising the legs and bodies that
               had necessarily been idle for the last fifteen days. The boulevard was deep with
               sloppy mud and the boys were wearing light barracks shoes, but they enjoyed it
               just as if they had been on the finest lawn in the world. They were on land
               again and they knew that no submarine could nose up under them and blow them all
               into  "kingdom come."  On the return trip to the boat, the companies marched
               through the principal streets of the city, crooked, narrow streets to be sure,
               but principal streets just the same. 
            </p>
            
            <p> The city of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stn">St. Nazaire</a> is situated at the
               mouth of the Loire River<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"river" [sic]</em></span></span>, and until within the last 75 years was a small village
               with a harbor that would accommodate only fishing vessels and boats engaged in
               trade along the coast. At this time it was found that the ports of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-bre">Brest</a> and <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-bor">Bordeaux</a> were not large enough to handle all the shipping that
               came to France from the Atlantic. To remedy
               this the French government decided to make improvements at the mouth of
               the Loire, so all but the largest
               type of ocean craft could come into the harbor and be docked. During the time
               these improvements were being made and after their completion, the population
               was greatly increased and the city itself was built up. Properly speaking it is
               not one of the oldest cities of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>, but to
               these men from <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a> it seemed to be the
               very superlative of all things old. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The first evening all the men were held on boats, but on the following evening a
               certain percent<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"per cent." [sic]</em></span></span> of each company was granted shore leave and these men explored the
               city in their way. They found a great difference from the things that they were
               used to at home. The shops were all small, and, with the exception of those
               handling military accouterments, very little display was made. It was almost
               impossible to buy anything to eat except roasted chestnuts. There were a few
               places where cheese sandwiches could be obtained, but they were more expensive
               than chicken dinners in <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">the States</a>, and as
               most of the men had spent most of their entire month's pay on their last trip to
               <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu">New York</a>, they invested in very few
               sandwiches. The French people were all anxious to talk to the <a href="organizations.html#aef">Americans</a> and it was then the men received their first
               lesson in French. They learned that  "bon soir" 
               meant  "good evening" ; that  "au revoir" 
               meant  "goodbye" ,  "bon chance"  meant
                "good luck" . If a Frenchman came up to a bunch of the boys and jabbered
               something at them that

               answer, for he would usually start jabbering again, and at his second pause the
               boys would repeat their vocabulary. Everyone seemed to enjoy their experience,
               but many a man berated himself because he had not studied French instead of
               German while in high school, and others because they had not taken French
               lessons in the camps in the States. Everything was different from anything they
               had ever seen before, but they liked it and started studying French at once.
            </p>
            
            <p>During the next four days, short exercises, marches<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"marchs" [sic]</em></span></span> and shore leaves were the things of most interest. Details were kept
               on the docks to take care of equipment and barrack bags as they were unloaded
               from the boat, and to handle the four days' rations that were issued to each
               company. 
            </p>
            
            <p>On the morning of the 6th of November, <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Michigan</a> left <a class="place" href="places.html#camp1">Camp No.
                  1</a>, and boarded a train composed of third-class coaches. Eight
               men were crowded into each compartment along with their personal equipment and
               two days' travel rations. This left them scarcely any place to sit down and of
               course lying down was out of the question. In the evening all the other
               companies left the boat and splashed through mud to the railroad yards, in the
               drizzling rain that had kept up, intermittantly, ever since their arrival in
               port. A careful scrutiny of the yards showed nothing but box cars and everyone
               thought that they would have to stand around in the rain until some passenger
               coaches were pulled in. They were soon disillusioned, however, for they found
               that they were to take the  "8-40"  train, so called because
               each of the box cars was marked  "Cheveaux 8,
               Hommes 40" . To get forty men into one of these dinky cars, along with
               their equipment and travel rations, meant that they must stand. There was no
               room to sit or lie down. Evidently transportation was scarce. They crowded in,
               piled their corned willy and hard tack in the middle of the floor, and made the
               best of it. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The train started at dark and moved slowly with frequent stops throughout the
               night. At one halt, a so-called French coffee station, the men were each given a
               cup full of villainous, black concoction closely resembling diluted furniture
               polish. Its only redeeming feature was the fact that it was scalding hot and
               that made it welcome to the men, who were wet and cold. There was no heat in the
               cars, and the men, wet from the late march through the rain, became chilled to
               the very marrow. For the first time since entering the service they were
               thoroughly disgusted.

            <p>When morning came, the sun showed itself for the first time since land was
               sighted and everyone after exercising on the station platform during the
               numerous stops, began to take a new interest in life. 
            </p>
            
            <p>After the morning repast of cold canned tomatoes and hard tack, the discomforts
               of the night were forgotten and the scenery occupied everyone's attention. On
               every hand there was beautiful level valleys divided into a patchwork of plots,
               and long sloping hills, terraced and cultivated to the very top. There were no
               scattered farm houses as in <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a>, but every
               few kilometers there was a small village of stone houses, red tiled roofs,
               crooked streets, and small gardens, nestling against the hill. The most
               prominent point in each village was its high-spired church. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The second night on the train was not as bad as the first. The men had thoroughly
               dried their clothes during the day, and some had opened their packs and had
               taken out the blankets as extra protection from the cold.
            </p>
            
            <p>The iron rations were eaten with relish, for the men were not yet fed up on it.
               Twice each day the French issued out their weird<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"wierd" [sic]</em></span></span> potion, under the name of coffee.
            </p>
            
            <p>The scenery the second day was virtually unchanged, except that the country was a
               bit rougher and did not seem so well cultivated as that nearer the coast. The
               villages, houses, and churches were all the same, the population apparently the
               same as at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stn">St. Nazaire</a>. A few young men in
               uniform, and all the rest old men, women and children.
            </p>
            
            <p>after noon on November 8, the train
               arrived at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-vau">Vaucouleurs-Sur-Muese</a>, and
               <a href="organizations.html#comoku">Oklahoma</a> unloaded. <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Michigan</a>, which had arrived at four o'clock the same morning, had already discovered that  "billets"  meant barn lofts with leaky roofs, dark
               wind-swept sheds and cold bare rooms in houses, instead of the comfortable rooms
               with feather beds that had been pictured to the boys. Both companies, however,
               soon found that they had no time to spend in their billets except while
               sleeping. Before leaving the train at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-vau">Vaucouleurs</a> the men heard their first sounds of war the faint
               rumble of artillery fire on the front between <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-tou">Toul</a> and <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-ver">Verdun</a>. Although
               the sound was indistinct the men felt that they were at last nearing the object
               of their search. They had traveled many thousands of miles and many days and at
               last they had drawn close to the war. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p>After two hours' delay the train moved on, and well after dark it arrived at
               <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-mau">Mauvages</a>, in the <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-meu">Department of Meuse</a>. The men who hobbled off the

               </div> barracks bags and what little
               hospital equipment they had, were an exact illustration of the statement made
               many months later,  "A fellow boards those cars at a height<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"heighth" [sic]</em></span></span> of six-feet-three, and twenty-four hours later tumbles off at
               about three-feet-six, just like a collapsed accordion<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"accordian" [sic]</em></span></span>." 
               
            </p>
            
            <p>Here the three hospital companies, <a href="organizations.html#comdcu">D. C.</a>,
               <a href="organizations.html#comoru">Oregon</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a>, had received their introduction to lofts and barns as
               sleeping apartments. The strange places made no difference to the boys that
               night, they were all so tired that any place where they could lie down and
               stretch out was welcome as the best of beds.
            </p>
            
            <p> In the chill of the next morning, though, the red-roofed houses looked dingy and
               dirty at close range, the crooked streets were sloppy, muddy, and lined with
               piles of barnyard manure, reeking and steaming. The people showed evidence of a
               soap famine. Even the sky was a dirty gray and promised more rain. The first
               duty was to clean out the billets and try to make them habitable. Kitchen sites
               were located and wood was "procured from the French. The men bathed or washed
               clothes in French style, in cold water, with soap, brushes and wooden paddles.
               These last articles were borrowed from French women washing nearby.
            </p>
            
            <p>There followed street cleaning. The populace did not understand why streets
               should be cleaned, and very few of the men could speak French enough to explain
               it. But they cleaned them just the same, and after a few days of hard labor the
               <a href="organizations.html#aef">Americans</a> gave to the old town a much more
               respectable and more sanitary appearance.
            </p>
            
            <p> On the 11th of November, <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a> opened the first hospital operated by the <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Sanitary Train</a> in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>. The building was a neglected, moldy old chateau when
               they started to clean it up. Hot water and vigorous scrubbing made it
               serviceable at the end of two days' hard labor. An epidemic of mumps arose among
               the <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Engineers</a> who were in the same town as
               the hospital section. With mumps and the ordinary sick, there were 74 patients
               in the hospital when <a href="organizations.html#comoru">Oregon</a> relieved <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a> on November
               15th. <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a>, after being relieved
               moved at once to <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-chl">Chalaines</a>, a small village
               just across the river from <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-vau">Vaucouleurs</a>.
               They took over a hospital from the French&#x2014;<a class="place" href="places.html#camphosp16">Camp Hospital No. 16</a>&#x2014;a large chateau and two wards
               nearby, one of which was an operating ward. This hospital handled the sick from
               the division, many mumps, and the usual influenza and throat troubles. A
               detachment of medical officers and female nurses from <a class="place" href="places.html#basehosp36">Base Hospital No. 36</a> were attached to <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a> while it was operating at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-chl">Chalaines</a>.

            <p>On the second of December,
               <a href="organizations.html#comoru">Oregon</a> closed its hospital at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-mau">Mauvages</a> and began a series of hikes and drills,
               for the purpose of toughening the men for what was to come later. While
               operating this hospital, they had cared for a total of 84 patients, a very
               difficult task, owing to the lack of medical supplies and hospital
               equipment.
            </p>
            
            <p>On December 5th
               <a href="organizations.html#comdcu">D. C.</a> left <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-mau">Mauvages</a> and hiked to <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-bev">Burey-en-Vaux</a>, a little village of about a dozen barn-like
               buildings grouped around an old chateau. In this chateau it opened <a class="place" href="places.html#camphosp17">Camp Hospital No. 17</a> and in a few days it
               received 25 patients.
            </p>
            
            <p>During the time that the hospitals were getting established, <a href="organizations.html#comoku">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Michigan</a> were busy in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-vau">Vaucouleurs</a>, but not in handling litters. Upon their arrival
               there a few days of repose were allowed, and during that time nearly all the men
               visited the ruins of an old castle, which was situated on the hill back of the
               town. The castle, built in the early part
               of the 15th century, is a heap of ruins, excepting its great stone
               archway, and an underground chapel. It was through this arch, called  "Porte de France,"  that <a class="person" href="people.html#jdarc">Jeanne d' Arc</a> rode when she came to the little
               underground chapel to pray for Divine aid and guidance in her mission of leading
               <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> to victory.
            </p>
            
            <p>The village of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-vau">Vaucouleurs</a> had two
               industries, a statute factory and a munitions plant. The former was the larger,
               employing in peace times several hundred men, women and girls. The munitions
               plant employed mostly women and girls, working on hand grenades. The streets
               were paved during <a class="person" href="people.html#caesar">Caesar's<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Ceasar's" [sic]</em></span></span></a> time, according to legend, but were still intact. The
               paving was not visible on the arrival of the troops, but after the details for
               the ambulance companies had labored for a few weeks, washing and sweeping in
               accordance with the custom of the Medical Department, they showed like new.
            </p>
            
            <p>After about a week of sightseeing, bathing, washing clothes, and studying French,
               the entire personnel of <a href="organizations.html#comoku">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Michigan</a>, with the exception of the street cleaning
               detail, were put to work handling supplies on the quay, where a large American
               Q. M. depot was being established. They unloaded and set up ambulances, escort
               and combat wagons and rolling kitchens. They carried bacon boxes, until they
               could grunt like pigs. They shoveled coal, corded wood, juggled oats and baled
               hay and in fact were temporarily the stevedore section for the entire <a href="organizations.html#div42">Rainbow Division</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>At about this time three, four-mule teams and wagons were issued to each of the
               three field hospitals and to <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Michigan</a>. They
               were sad looking mules, just off the boat after a voyage of a

            <p>On November 16, <a class="person" href="people.htmlfwmcafee">Captain
                  Frederick W. McAfee</a> of <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Michigan</a>,
               with a detail of 55 men, traveled by train to <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-par">Paris</a> and spent 12 hours in the forbidden city. In the evening
               they were taken to a big farm near <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-mea">Meaux</a>,
               the farthest point reached by <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">the Boche</a> in
               1914. The next day they started for <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-vau">Vaucouleurs</a> with 36 <a class="person" href="people.html#hford">Ford</a> ambulances under their own power, arriving two days later. Twenty-four of these ambulances
               were turned over to <a href="organizations.html#comoku">Oklahoma</a>, six to <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a>, and the remainder scattered among the
               regiments. These ambulances were used for collecting patients from the
               regimental infirmaries and for evacuating patients from <a class="place" href="places.html#camphosp16">Camp Hospitals 16</a> and <a class="place" href="places.html#camphosp17">17</a>, to <a class="place" href="places.html#basehosp36">Base

               <a class="place" href="places.html#basehosp18">No. 18</a> at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-baz">Bazois</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>On December 11 both <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a> and <a href="organizations.html#comdcu">D. C.</a> evacuated
               their and that evening the barrack bags of all five companies were packed up and
               sent away. The rumors that had been circulating for a week were coming true. The
               train was going to move. Every man felt as if he were an old campaigner by this
               time and wanted to go towards the front.
            </p>
            
            <p>Instead of toward, the hike lead away from the front. On the morning
               of the 12th, <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a> and <a href="organizations.html#commiu">Michigan</a> with their kitchens and equipment on
               wagons, and their men marching, started from <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-vau">Vaucouleurs</a> in the rear of the supply train column, and behind
               them came <a href="organizations.html#comoku">Oklahoma</a>. At <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-bev">Burey-en-Vaux</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comdcu">D. C.</a> was lined
               up and joined the column. Fortunately the roads were dry and the marching was
               comparatively easy, as marching with a full pack goes. At noon a halt was made at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-msv">Maxy-sur-Vaise</a> and iron rations were munched. After an hour the
               column moved on again. The afternoon was not so easy as the morning. The sun
               seemed boiling hot. Pack straps began to chafe tired shoulders, blistered feet
               became more painful and the attending ambulances soon became loaded. At dark the
               column stopped at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-msm">Maxey-sur-Meuse</a> and the
               men were billeted in barns and lofts. <a href="organizations.html#comoru">Oregon</a>
               and <a href="organizations.html#secam">the hospital headquarters</a> arrived ahead of
               the main column, under the guidance of a company of M. P.'s who had been lost on
               the road three times during the day. After supper everybody literally  "hit the
               hay" , and slept soundly until first call roused them. The men stretched
               their aching bodies, dressed and fell in for reveille. By 8:30 o'clock, the column was on the move again.
            </p>
            
            <p>Soon after setting out the column passed through the ancient and historic
               <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-dlp">Domremy</a>, the birthplace and girlhood
               home of <a class="person" href="people.html#jdarc">d'Arc</a>. The house where she was born

               <a class="person" href="people.html#jdarc">Jeanne</a> was herding sheep when she saw the
               vision which inspired her to the task of leading her countrymen against the
               invader.
            </p>
            
            <p>Before noon the column had
               passed through the old city of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-neu">Neufchateau</a>
               and an hour later it stopped at the roadside for lunch. All afternoon they
               marched, and in the evening stopped at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-gon">Goncourt</a>. Here the men were quartered in Adrian barracks, and
               spent the night on bare wooden bunks. 
            </p>
            
            <p>In the morning packs were rolled and the grounds were policed. The wagons had
               been sent ahead with orders to halt after fifteen miles'<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"miles" [sic]</em></span></span> journey and prepare hot dinner for the men marching. However, the
               regular army officer in charge of the night's resting place, after making microscopic<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"miscroscopic" [sic]</em></span></span> inspection, decided that the <a href="organizations.html#natguard">National
                  Guard</a> men had not properly cleaned the camp. The companies that
               had already marched out into the highway were called back. Packs were unslung
               and policing started again. There were about 1000 men in the group and the
               grounds were again gone over thoroughly, but still it did not please the chloric
               officer, and he ordered it all done a third time.  "Pick up
               everything the size of a match stick or larger, in the whole valley,"  was
               the order passed down by the sanitary sergeants.
            </p>
            
            <p>Never did Germans hate British as the men of that column hated that picayunishly
               exacting officer, but they picked up match sticks while they were hating. An
               hour before noon <a class="person" href="people.html#wamann">Major General Mann</a>, the
               divisional commander, drove up in his car and the officer responsible for
               detaining the column was brought before him. Immediately after the General's car
               rolled away the column moved out. They had been held for four hours on a trivial
               pretext.
            </p>
            
            <p>This day's march was the hardest of the entire trip. The men were chilled and
               miserable, for it had been raining nearly all the time that they had been
               waiting. A company of <a href="organizations.html#aef">doughboys</a> without packs
               headed the column and set a pace uphill a little slower than double time. After
               reaching the top of this three-kilometer hill, the troops passed a section of
               trenches and barbwire entanglements, one of the training sectors of the French.
               The <a href="organizations.html#fr-military">French troops</a> drilling there stuck
               their heads up and gazed, in wonderment and surprise, at the <a href="organizations.html#aef">Americans</a> as they raced by as if the whole <a href="organizations.html#gw-military">German army</a> was close upon their heels.
            </p>
            
            <p>Dinner time came but no dinner. The kitchens had gone ahead according to their
               original orders. Before <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stb">St. Blin</a> was
               reached

               </div> at four o'clock in the
               afternoon, it was discovered that a great number of the men had
               fallen out, unable to stand the man-killing<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"mankilling" [sic]</em></span></span> pace without food. Some of these men rejoined their companies within a
               few days and others spent time in the hospitals before they were able to go back
               to duty. <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stb">St. Blin</a> was juat as small and as
               muddy as the average French village. Dingy old houses, dirty streets with the
               inevitable pile of fertilizer, were its earmarks, and curious peasant
               people.
            </p>
            
            <p>The train was quartered in draughty, thin-boarded Adrian barracks furnished with
               wooden bunks that were new and clean. No bedding was furnished by the army, but
               the boys were not long in finding a Frenchman who was willing to sell straw at
               the rate of two francs per tick full, so they were able to make themselves
               fairly comfortable after the first bike in France. The heating arrangements was
               a small stove at one end of the long building, but it was so small and wood so
               scarce that it was of virtually no use. The only way to keep warm during the
               winter weather at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stb">St. Blin</a> was to go to
               bed. 
            </p>
            
            <p>On the 15th of December, the first heavy snow fell
               and after it came rain and sleet, leaving the ground and roads covered with a
               solid sheet of ice. The mules were all smooth-shod and until some of them could
               be reshod, it was almost impossible to draw rations for the companies.
            </p>
            
            <p>In spite of these weather conditions, a five-mile hike with full pack was
               scheduled for each day,  "in order to get the men into condition" .

               men left at <a class="place" href="places.htmlfr-chl">Chalaines</a> by <a href="organizations.html#comcou">Colorado</a> to care for patients who could not be
               moved, rejoined their company. On Christmas Eve<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"eve" [sic]</em></span></span>, a small consignment of mail and packages was received,
               bringing a taste of Christmas joy to the hearts of these men who were spending
               their first winter in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>. Christmas dinner
               included turkey, with as many of the of the trimmings as could be obtained. The
               troops showed their spirit by decorating their barracks with holly and
               mistlletoe gathered from the nearby hills. For the first time since their
               arrival in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> the men were permitted to
               send cablegrams to the folks, thereby<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"therby" [sic]</em></span></span> leaving a few words of cheer in their vacant places by the old home

            <p>As usual during a move, the rain came down in torrents and everyone was drenched
               to the skin. but the boys made the best of it and relieved their feelings by
               singing the then popular song,  "Where Do We Go From Here."  As to this they
               had not long to wonder, however, for on October

               <a href="organizations.html#comnju">New Jersey</a> and <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraska</a>, loaded on a ferry which took them to <a class="place" href="places.htmlnju-wee">Weehauken, N. J.</a>, where they entrained for

            <p>Nearly everyone in the organizations stationed at <a class="place" href="places.html#campmerritt">Camp Merritt</a>, received passes to visit <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-nyc">New York City</a>, and the men from <a class="place" href="places.html#nju">New Jersey</a> visited their homes.

            <p>On November 12, <a class="person" href="people.html#jgwimpfheimer">Private Jacques D. Wimpfheimer<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Wimpheimer" [sic]</em></span></span></a> was sent to the hospital in <a class="place" href="places.html#nju-eng">Englewood, New Jersey</a>. A few days later he was removed to a
               hospital in <a class="place" href="places.html#nju-hob">Hoboken</a> and on January 23, 1918, he died of pneumonia. He was the

               merchant.
            </p>
            
            <p>On the morning of November 14, 1917, the four
               organizations received orders to embark a second time for <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a>. This was accomplished the same morning. <a href="organizations.html#secam">Ambulance section headquarters</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comnju">New Jersey</a> and <a href="organizations.html#comtnu">Tennessee</a>, embarked on the R. M. S.  "Aurania"  at <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-p56">pier 56, New York City</a>, and <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraska</a> embarked on the White Star liner
                "Celtic"  at <a class="place" href="places.html#nyu-p60">pier 60, New York
                  City</a>. Both ships put out to sea at about 3:30 the same afternoon.
            </p>
            
            <p>Life on board these English ships was more pleasant than it had been on the
                "Grant."  The men had better living quarters and were not so crowded.
               There were canteens aboard these

               tobacco and cigarettes, cakes and fruit could be purchased at reasonable
               rates.
            </p>
            
            <p>The  "Aurania"  was a better ship for comfort but the kitchen was English and
               it is needless to say that  "Chaze and Tay, twice a day"  was the diet during
               the voyage. The voyagers touched at <a class="place" href="places.html#hac">Halifax, Nova
                  Scotia</a>, November 16, at 4
               o'clock P. M. While here an opportunity was given all men to write
               home, the letters being gathered, censored and sent ashore. After waiting there
               forty-eight hours they joined the other ships of the convoy, nine in all, and
               put out to sea. A British cruiser in the harbor paid the <a href="organizations.html#aef">Americans</a> a tribute by allowing her band to play the  "Star
               Spangled Banner"  and the crew stood at attention as the convoy steamed
               past.
            </p>
            
            <p>In spite of the bad weather the different organizations proceeded through a
               regular schedule of physical exercises and lifeboat drill. The gunners on the
                "Celtic"  had target practice from time to time. The concerts which were
               rendered by the <a href="organizations.html#sec168band"><a href="organizations.html#commiu">168th
                     Infantry</a> band</a> on the  "Aurania,"  the first few
               days of the trip, had to be discontinued on entering the war zone.
            </p>
            
            <p>Due to the efforts of two <a href="organizations.html#ca-ymca">Canadian Y. M. C. A.</a>
               secretaries, who were crossing, to join their troops at the front, several first
               class entertainments were produced during the voyage. Among the best was a
               minstrel show given by a few of the boys from <a class="place" href="places.html#nju">New
                  Jersey</a> and a benefit performance for <a href="organizations.html#orphans">the
                  Orphans of British Seamen</a>, in which members of the company took
               part. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The English sailors could not understand many traits of American soldiers, above
               all, how they could play poker and joke with such care-free actions when danger
               was all around.
            </p>
            
            <p>When on November 25, the men were ordered to sleep
               with their clothes and life belts on, it was easy to guess that the convoy had
               reached the danger zone. November 28 proved to be
               the most exciting day of the journey, when something very similar to a periscope
               made its appearance a short distance away and passed within a hundred yards of
               the  "Aurania."  The Sharpshooters who had been posted at different points on
               the ship some time before, opened fire with rifles. The  "Celtic" 
               immediately spun around, so as to present as small a target as possible, opening
               fire with her stern guns. Two destroyers were immediately on the scene firing
               perhaps a dozen shots in rapid succession. The alleged periscope disappeared,
               and the fleet changed its course, putting into <a class="place" href="places.html#ie-bel">Belfast</a> harbor about dark. While the troop ships lay in the
               harbor, the accompanying destroyers scoured the Irish
               coast for submarines and mines.
            </p>
            
            <p>Morning brought the rumor of a naval engagement and a

            <p>It was just a coincidence that <a class="person" href="people.html#jbrownlee">Private James
                  Brownlee</a> of the <a href="organizations.html#comnju">New Jersey
                  company</a> could stand on deck at this point and see the chimney of
               his mother's home in <a class="place" href="places.html#ie-bel">Belfast</a>, which he had
               left as a boy, ten years before. But being in the army and shore leaves not
               being granted, he was near and yet far. Taking a furlough from his post on
               the Rhine
               fifteen months later, <a class="person" href="people.html#jbrownlee">Brownlee</a> was at last permitted to visit his mother.
            </p>
            
            <p>The fleet lay in the harbor on Thanksgiving day,
               while the stomachs of the men were being insulted with Australian rabbit,
               refrigerated for an uncertain number of years and finally cooked with the hair
               on. The  "Aurania"  had been transporting <a href="organizations.html#ca-military">Canadian troops</a> to <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> for
               three years. Maybe the management did not remember that the American Thanksgiving was a feast day, and that to
               starve <a href="organizations.html#pplus">Americans</a> on that festive occasion was
               injury to the extreme.
            </p>
            
            <p>Leaving two freighters, one of which was disabled, the remaining seven ships left
               the harbor of <a class="place" href="places.html#ie-bel">Belfast</a> at 2:30 o'clock on the afternoon of
               Thanksgiving, convoyed by nine destroyers. They proceeded at top
               speed under cover of darkneas to <a class="place" href="places.html#uk-liv">Liverpool,
                  England</a>, casting anchor at one
               o'clock A. M., December 1, 1917. It was indeed a happy crowd who
               marched down the gang plank and immediately to the depot of the London and
               Northwestern railway.
            </p>
            
            <p>It was on this march that <a class="person" href="people.html#jkeenan">Private Joseph
                  Keenan</a> of the <a href="organizations.html#comtnu">Tennessee company</a>
               passed within a few blocks of his childhood home but was unable to leave his
               company to visit his people. <a class="person" href="people.html#jkeenan">Keenan</a> was also
               granted a pass to <a class="place" href="places.html#enk">England</a> while quartered<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Quartered" [sic]</em></span></span> on the Rhine more than a year
               later.
            </p>
            
            <p>After waiting nine hours in the cold, <a class="person" href="people.html#dswilson">Major
                  Wilson</a>, in charge of the troops, was approached by an English
               Lieutenant, in charge of railway transportation, who announced the coming of the
               troop train by saying  "<a class="person" href="people.html#kinggeorgev">The
                  King</a> has granted you permission to ride" . Accordingly all
               four organizations were loaded into third class coaches and pulled out for
               <a class="place" href="places.html#campwendledown">Camp Wendledown</a>, <a class="place" href="places.html#uk-win">Winchester</a>. The train stopped at <a class="place" href="places.html#uk-bir">Birmingham</a> for an hour, where tea and coffee were
               served. The men were granted permission to leave the train and stretch their
               legs during, the pause. It was here that a rather distinguished looking
               Englishman past middle age, accompanied by a woman, presumably his wife, gazed
               curiously at a group of American soldiers and finally asked: 
            </p>
            
            <p> "What province are you from?" </p>
            
            <p> "No province sir,"  answered the boys.  "We are

            </p>
            
            <p> "Ah, how singular,"  she exclaimed.  "I have
               been in <a class="place" href="places.html#ua-mem">Memphis</a> but I never knew that

               long, cold, uphill hike to the  "rest camp" . After a delay of an hour or so
               they were assigned billets which were constructed of corrugated iron sheeting,
               with varnished cloth windows and each man was given three pieces of plank for a
               bed. 
            </p>
            
            <p>In the morning they awoke to find themselves in the center of a large English
               training camp. It was their first experience with the Adrian barracks, equipped
               with one small stove, and allowed one whole bucket of coal every twenty-four
               hours.
            </p>
            
            <p>During the stay, part of the time was spent in sightseeing hikes in and about the
               city of <a class="place" href="places.html#uk-win">Winchester</a>. Some of the most
               interesting sights were King Arthur's Round Table, <a class="place" href="places.htmluk-win-col">College</a> and <a class="place" href="places.html#uk-win-chu">Church of
                  Winchester</a>, the college being the oldest in <a class="place" href="places.html#enk">England</a>. Most of the spare time in camp was spent in
               Hooverizing on English rations of bread, cheese and tea. The menu was changed
               only once, when sardines were substituted for cheese.

               Channel cooped up on the  "Marguerite."  Just before sailing,
               the king again opened up his heart and issued one tin of bully-beef per man.
               Some of the braver hearts tackled this beef and proceeded to wrestle with it all
               during the voyage, but the beef won in nearly every case and the fish profited
               thereby. No one doubted that the officer who had charge of loading the good ship
               "Marguerite" had had previous experience as a packer in a sardine factory.

               was served once during the two days'<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"days" [sic]</em></span></span> trip.

            <p>The hungry, sleepy, and half frozen <a href="organizations.html#aef">Americans</a>
               arrived at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-laf">La Fouche</a> at about nine o'clock on the morning of December
               15, detrained and hiked a mile and a half to the town. It had a
               popu1ation of about half a hundred souls. At last the <a href="organizations.html#aef">Americans</a> had found one of those long looked for French
               Chateaux.
            </p>
            
            <p>But how different was it in reality, from what had been expected! In the
               assignment of billets, <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraska</a> drew
               compartments in the crumbling outer wall of a demolished castle, built in the
               fifteenth century, and the other companies were housed in the town proper, in
               shacks more or less dilapidated, entirely lacking in conveniences and even
               without heat. On December 22, these dismal
               quarters were honored by a visit from the new division commander, <a class="person" href="people.html#ctmenoher">Major General Charles T. Menoher</a>, who had
               succeeded <a class="person" href="people.html#wamann">General Mann</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Had it not been for the reserve rations the men carried in their packs, these two
               weeks would have been  "eatless days"  indeed. The greater part of the
               division which had come to <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> a month
               earlier, was now in the middle of a long overland hike, and was far removed from
               the American base of supplies. Rations were scarce and the arrival of 350 more
               men only made matters worse. The only meal of the two weeks was on Christmas day, when all precedents were violated
               and an ambulance was dispatched to scour the countryside and spend the mess
               funds for anything the French populace would part with. A mixture of canned meat
               and onions with hard tack and coffee twice a day was the unaltering menu.
            </p>
            
            <p>No word but desolate, could have rightly described Lafauche <span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"La Fouche" [sic]</em></span></span>. It was perched on the side of a big hill a kilometer from the main
               road. In sight were many other villages of the same size, all muddy, dirty and
               deserted looking. Fuel was at a premium. <a href="organizations.html#comnju">The Jersey
                  men</a> were assessed two francs each the next pay day to remunerate
               their landlord for his fagots that they had appropriated in lieu of
               fuel.
            </p>
            
            <p>Division headquarters offices were in Lafauche<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"La Fouche" [sic]</em></span></span>, set up in a group of Adrian barracks on the edge of town. The other
               five companies of the train were five kilometers away at a small town called

               <div class="dropcap">L</div><span class="uppercase">est</span> the truths set forth in
               this chapter appear to be a veiled criticism of necessary and rightful
               authority; or lest they assume the guise of a complaint against the ordinary
               hardships of a soldier's outdoor life, it is well to recall the time when the
               incidents took place. The year 1917 was still alive.
               The <a href="organizations.html#aef">American Expeditionary Force</a> in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> was still an experiment. The old methods of
               handling an army, in force since the Spanish-American war, had not been altered
               to fit the conditions of the greatest war the world had ever seen.
            </p>
            
            <p>It is not worthwhile<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"worth while" [sic]</em></span></span> to dwell upon the success of this <a href="organizations.html#aef">A. E.
                  F.</a> experiment. Such victories are not won in seclusion. Everybody
               knows that <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a> built up the most wonderful
               and efficient service of supply that ever existed, and kept alive an army on the
               other side of the globe from her resources. But that was an accomplishment of
               the next year. Until Christmas, 1917, much of
               America's shipping facilities was still in the forest and mine. The wonderful
               service of supply existed only on paper. The <a href="organizations.html#aef">American
                  fighting force</a> had everything to learn about modern warfare and
               the French and British were still holding the line. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The people in <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a> were contributing
               lavishly and blindly of their money, only wondering what the outcome of this
               experiment would be. The officers and men of the <a href="organizations.html#aef">A. E.
                  F.</a> in the meantime waited in their muddy French villages, also
               wondering what the outcome would be, knowing that they were the material upon
               which the experiment would be tried. And among them was the <a href="organizations.html#st117">117th Sanitary Train</a> in Lafauche <span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"La Fouche" [sic]</em></span></span> and <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stb">St. Blin</a>. In justice to the
               men, it must be said that their dread of the coming march was not born of any
               silk-stockinged mollycoddleism. It was evident that their present abodes were
               not permanent, for deep as were the mysteries of army movements at that time,
               the men knew that their ultimate destination lay much farther ahead, three or
               four days' walking distance. 
            </p>
            
            <p>If a great many of the men grumbled at the prospect of walking through country
               netted by railroads, it was because they did not realize that the battle then
               raging in <a class="place" href="places.htmlit">Italy</a> was taxing the French railroads
               to their very limit. The two thousand cars necessary to transport the division
               by rail could ill be spared from the Allies' lines of supply, to say nothing of
               fuel and engines. The

               as they should be, but they did not stop to consider that <a class="place" href="places.html#xxu">America</a>'s war plans, like all new things, were subject to many
               mistakes and subsequent corrections; and that they, who had come early, must
               accept the consequences of the inevitable mistakes.
            </p>
            
            <p>For a few days previous to Christmas, rumors had been floating around, to the
               effect that the train was to make a three-day hike. Consequently, at first call
               for reveille everyone awakened expectantly on the
               morning of December 27, just before dawn. It had been very cold, and
               during the night five or six inches of snow had fallen. By the time everyone was
               dressed, light of day had driven away the inky darkness of the night before. And
               what a sight was presented to the eyes! The earth, building and every tree, were
               enveloped in a great white blanket, such as only nature can provide. The air was
               full of large feathery flakes, that were slowly descending to thicken that
               blanket. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Had the men been at home, with sleds and sleighs, this day would have been a
               delightful one, but that little dream had to be banished. The hard fact that
               this was <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> and they were as yet not
               acclimated, and a long hike was to begin in an hour, put an entirely different
               interpretation on the picture without. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The <a href="organizations.html#hqds"><a class="person" href="people.html#jwgrissinger">Division
                     Surgeon</a>'s office force</a> had fared luckier that the
               train's personnel, for it had departed by truck for <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-rol">Rolampont</a> the day before, making the complete trip in a day.
               Frost-bitten ears and fingers made the trip miserable enough for them, but when
               compared with the pedestrian's experience, the trucks were palace cars.
            </p>
            
            <p><a href="organizations.html#secam">Ambulance section headquarters</a> and <a href="organizations.html#secfh">fie1d hospital headquarters</a> hiked with the train,
               enduring the hardships of those memorable days as best they could. Every company
               was short of transportation and as a result, the few combat wagons available
               were loaded to the breaking point, in some cases to be drawn by two smooth-shod
               mules over roads that would have rendered an empty wagon a burden. 
            </p>
            
            <p>A few moments after 8 o'clock, <a href="organizations.html#secam">ambulance section headquarters</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comnju">Jersey</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comtnu">Tennessee</a>,
               and <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraska</a>, left the village of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-laf">La Fouche</a> whither they knew not, and cared less,
               so long as they got there. Hiking was anything but easy, plodding through eight
               inches of snow, under a sixty-pound pack. Many of the men's shoes were
               completely unserviceable and they made their first letters from home serve a
               dual purpose, inserting them in their shoes to keep their feet off the
               ground.
            </p>
            
            <p>There were a great many trucks on the road, all heavily loaded, going in the same
               direction the troops were marching.

                  <div class="top-center">The Hike</div>
               </div> These trucks had to have the
               middle of the road. If they veered too much to one side they were sure to skid
               into the ditch, which meant a delay of perchance a whole day. This forced the
               men to keep well over to the right of the road where the ground was slanting and
               the footing uncertain.
            </p>
            
            <p>Anybody who ever traveled over a French highway knows what the right hand side
               looks like. Besides the trees which stand thirty feet apart, the government
               keeps small piles of crushed rock, stacked between every two trees, for the
               purpose of repairing the road. So it was around these trees and over these rock
               piles on the slanting roadside that part of the column had to plod.
            </p>
            
            <p>Fifty minutes of hiking and ten minutes of rest per hour was the plan followed.
               About 10 o'clock A. M. the column
               reached <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stb">St. Blin</a> and the complete train was
               once more together for the first time since leaving <a class="place" href="places.html#campmills">Camp Mills</a>. The last hike they had taken together was on
               <a class="place" href="places.htmlnyu-lon">Long Island</a>, without packs, over the
               best roads in the world, on an ideal autumn morning. This reminded them of that
               hike, because it was so different. In a few minutes the five additional
               companies had taken their places in line. These five organizations had been in
               France six weeks, and had made one long hike and had done much outdoor labor. In
               that respect they were better prepared for the coming ordeal than the group from Lafauche<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"La Fouche" [sic]</em></span></span>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Someone was setting the pace with a motorcycle, who evidently had no idea what
               walking in a new-fal1en snow was like. This gait was especially hard on the
               three companies who had already been hiking for two hours. Within a short time,
               <a href="organizations.html#comoku">Oklahoma</a>'s four accompanying  "Flivvers"  came into demand, as the snow combined with the
               huge pack, containing most everything a soldier needs but the kitchen stove, had
               commenced to tell on the embryo campaigners. A few fell out before noon, but as
               the day grew older, the number of exhausted increased, and the ambulances had
               all they could do to bring in the stragglers. 
            </p>
            
            <p>A halt was called at noon on the
               outskirts of Rimaucourt<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Remicourt" [sic]</em></span></span> for lunch. The train marched into an open field by the roadside and
               there, feet buried in the snow, unslung packs and waited for the wagon train to
               catch up. When it came, coffee would be made and served. The thermometer stood
               very close to zero. Every man's clothing was moist from perspiration and it took
               a very few minutes to chill the men to the bone. Here the foundation was laid
               for many cases of pneumonia that developed in the next few days for an hour had
               passed before each man had received his one-third cup of half-boiled black
               unsweetened coffee.

            <p>Oh! how they wished they had some of the honey they had  "bought"  a few days before. A Frenchman near <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-stb">St.
                  Blin</a> discovered while the troops were there that a bee-hive had
               been robbed. The <a href="organizations.html#st117">sanitary train</a> had not seen any
               of the honey, but they were camped near and were taxed to cover the loss anyway.
               The lost honey was less than a quart. The bill was six hundred francs, and it
               was paid. And now, with all their hearts, the men wished they had stolen hives
               and all. But the bitter coffee was gulped down and the men waited impatiently
               for the tramp to start again, for they could at least keep warm marching.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the afternoon, the train passed through Rimaucourt<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Remicourt" [sic]</em></span></span>. The very elements of nature had conspired against them. One hill
               after another in rapid succession, with hardly ever a descent, combined with a
               blinding snowstorm, almost a blizzard in form, made progress not only painful
               but next to impossible. Many of the unseasoned lads fell exhausted into the snow
               trusting that an ambulance would come along before nightfall. 
            </p>
            
            <p>About dusk the column reached the little lane leading to the village of Ecot<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Echot" [sic]</em></span></span>, about one kilometer from the main road. <a href="organizations.html#secam">Ambulance section headquarters</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comnju">Jersey</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comtnu">Tennessee</a> and <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraska</a>, were assigned to this town for the night.
               A feeble tubercular cheer arose from the men of these four organizations, for at
               last the end of the trail was in sight where a place to rest might be had. The
               billets were good, being in an old chateau and in houses near it. Some of the
               rooms even had fireplaces and fires were built, though officially there were no
               fires, for officially there was no fuel. The stack of wood in the court yard
               belonged to the Frenchman who owned the chateau. Some of the men spent part of
               their rightful sleeping while trying to negotiate legitimately for the wood, but
               most of the men pursued a less exemplary, but more practical course, and had a
               fire. The wife of the old Frenchman took pity on the wet, shivering soldiers and
               told them to be careful and get the wood between five and six o'clock while her
               husband was in the back hall milking the goats, or he would make trouble for
               them. After the fires were roaring and the men were having the novel experience
               of thawing, they threw their packs on the floor and fell on top of them, too
               tired to get up two hours later for supper. Soon all minds were dead to the
               world sleeping only as exhausted men can, dreamless and quiet even upon a
               mattress of oak. 
            </p>
            
            <p><a href="organizations.html#secfh">Field hospital headquarters</a> and the five
               companies who started last, pushed on to <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-for">Forcey</a> the same evening, where they were to spend the night.
               Due to an oversight, probably, it was more than an hour after they arrived in
               town before billets could

               the men assigned places, in spite of the fact that a billeting officer had been
               sent ahead to prepare for the emergency. At the end of this hour of waiting in
               the street, the men were rewarded with well-ventilated billets. For there were
               plenty of holes in the roof and some in the walls as well. These barns were as
               cold within as the streets without, except that there was a place to take refuge
               from the winds.
            </p>
            
            <p>Morning brought unique problems. Under the hay and blankets the all-essential
               feet had swollen out of proportion, while on the floor every shoe had frozen
               stiff. Some of the men lighted candles inside of their shoes, others stuffed
               them full of hay and set the hay on fire. The barn was full of smoke and
               resourcefulness, and by 9:30 o'clock,
               when the companies from Ecot<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Echot" [sic]</em></span></span> arrived, they were ready to go, and go they did, in the same
               direction, southward and upward, slipping and limping.
            </p>
            
            <p>The second day tested the soldier's mettle. After the column had left <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-for">Forcey</a> an hour behind, snow once more started
               falling. Again it was driven by a gale that assumed the appearance of a
               blizzard. The thermometer started falling and continued to drop all day. It was
               impossible to see a hundred yards ahead. Stragglers increased in number. Men who
               fell out lay prone in the snow, or sat propped up against trees by the roadside,
               waiting for the overworked ambulances.
            </p>
            
            <p>At noon a halt was called for lunch. The
               meal consisted of cold corned beef sandwiches. The first five minutes saw the
               sandwiches disappear, but the prescribed hour rest had to be observed, and the
               airing that went along with it had to be endured. The time was spent in trying
               prescriptions for keeping warm without a fire. Finally the march was resumed and
               the men were glad to be on their way once more.
            </p>
            
            <p>The afternoon was a repetition of the morning.</p>
            
            <p>The worst of all calamities befell the <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraskans</a>. Their kitchen was in the ditch, incidentally, the
               accident occurred just before noon. The hill had been hard for those on foot,
               but for the donkeys and wagon, it had been too much. The mules tried and failed.
               The driver coaxed the team in ways known only to his profession and failed. Then
               men were called to help, and they were successful in pushing the load half way
               up the grade where it slipped and ran backward, off the road and upside down.
               Then the air grew warm, for if <a class="person" href="people.html#wtsherman">Sherman</a> had
               been in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr">France</a> instead of <a class="place" href="places.html#gau">Georgia</a> he would have used more than three words to describe
               war.
            </p>
            
            <p>The whole wagon train was stuck. This meant to summon help from the  "<a href="organizations.html#allies">Allies</a>,"  or let the men go to bed without

               </div> per. So a Frenchman was called into conference.
               Much confab followed. After wild gestures with head and limbs and a discreet use
               of a few familiar words, the  "Frog"  understood. He thereupon spat out a
               string of  "oui',"  and departed, returning
               presently with a yoke of oxen. One at a time the wagons were towed to the top of
               the hill, and the wagon train struggled on. The Frenchman accepted two cane of
                "corned bill"  for his trouble and seemed delighted with the
               remuneration. If this had been the last hill, all would have been well, but
               there were others. Twice that afternoon it was necessary to remove half the load
               from each wagon at the foot of the hill, and pull the rest to the top, sending
               the wagons back to get the rest of the load.
            </p>
            
            <p>At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-man">Mandres</a>
               greeted<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"greated" [sic]</em></span></span> the eyes of the marching troops. <a href="organizations.html#comnju">Jersey</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comtnu">Tennessee</a>, <a href="organizations.html#comneu">Nebraska</a> and <a href="organizations.html#secam">ambulance section
                  headquarters</a> were to spend their second night there and they
               halted for the day. It was a small town of hospitable people and airy billets,
               and the temperature had fallen ten degrees below zero, Fahrenheit.
            </p>
            
            <p>Again the other five companies struggled a little farther on, halting at
               <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-nog">Nogent-en-Bassigny</a> where they were
               quartered. It was their turn for better quarters, and they got them. The billets
               were warm and the cafes in town had hot meals for sale. Needless to say, they
               did a rushing business. The men profited by the experience of the night before
               and took their shoes to bed with them, where the heat of their bodies prevented
               them from freezing. And the next morning the thermometer was hovering around
               fifteen below zero.
            </p>
            
            <p>The men in <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-man">Mandres</a> did not take off any of
               their clothes. They were ready to start at the first bugle note, when they threw
               themselves free from their blankets and 8
               o'clock found the column on the road again. Every man was traveling
               on his nerve next day. A number of the hikers had to be left behind at
               <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-man">Mandres</a> to be called for by ambulances
               later. The rest of the train fell in line at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-nog">Nogent</a> about 9:30. The
               column was shorter by this time but the train was on the home stretch at last.
               Those hardy ones remaining were rewarded by a few rays of sun. Even the early
               morning was bright and before 10 o'clock
               the weather started to moderate. Hiking was comfortable, even though every man
               was tired and footsore. 
            </p>
            
            <p>At noon on December 29, the commander of
               the column called a halt in the village of <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-rol">Rolampont</a>, where <a href="organizations.html#div42">42nd Division
                  Headquarters</a> was already situated. The ambulance men had reached
               their destination.
            </p>
            
            <p>A reason was never stated for making the Christmas hike.

               <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-tou">Toul sector</a> where unusual activity was
               threatened. But neither was authenticated. To the men it was a campaign, and by
               no means the easiest one in the war. Whatever the purpose might have been, that
               purpose was thwarted by the unexpected blizzard. If it was planned as a
               hardening and strengthening maneuver for the men, the plan was frustrated, for
               the worst blizzard of an unusually severe winter on the Langres plateau overtook them before the journey was half
               made.
            </p>
            
            <p>The most unhappy recollections of the service overseas are draped about the
               happenings during this early campaign against cold and unfitness for hardships.
               The flies and stench and sleepless nights of the month at <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-cth">Chateau-Thierry</a> ; the muck and bottomless roads
               and ceaseless rain and hostile bombers of the
               Argonne ; neither was hard enough to make the men complain,
               because at that time they understood the necessity of it all. And in those later
               months they understood that this first battle with King Winter was only the
               reward of a volunteer, who came early to be sacrificed to the American cause
               while it was still in the experimental stage. The discontent at the time was due
               to the apparent non-necessity of it all, or perhaps memories of comrades who
               need not have died.
            </p>
            
            <p>Refreshed by an eighteen hour rest, the four hospital companies with their
               headquarters detachment renewed the march from <a class="place" href="places.html#fr-rol">Rolampont</a> on the morning of December 30. The day
               was clear and fair and had advantages over some of the foregoing ones, but it
               was a painful hike. They passed on over the heights of Langres and down on the last lap of the journey to Longeaux<span class="tooltip">&#x2020; &nbsp;<span class="tooltiptext"><em>"Longeau" [sic]</em></span></span>, arriving there at 3 o'clock in the
               afternoon, and being assigned to quarters.
            </p>
            
            <p>They marched into regulation French barracks, with floors of soft mud and a small
               sheet-iron stove at one end. They made themselves comfortable there and waited
               for the coming of  "Happy New Year."

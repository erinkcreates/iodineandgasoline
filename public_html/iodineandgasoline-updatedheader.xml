                <p>The train was composed of eight companies from as many states. The staff
                    consisted of enlisted men of all Medical Department ranks permissable in a

                    to write. The necessary authority and money was supplied by <persName

                        <orgName ref="#div42">42nd Infantry Division</orgName> is familiar to every
                    American who read the newspapers or who gathered to discuss the status of the
                        <placeName ref="#xxu">United States</placeName> in regard to the Great
                    European War and the extent to which we intended to enter the struggle, during
                    the months which made up the summer and autumn of 1917. It is familiar because
                    it concerned the first full National Guard Division to sail overseas and because
                    this particular division represented many states of <placeName ref="#xxu">the
                        Union</placeName> and every section of the country. It is familiar because
                    it brought grim realization of the part the nation was to play by taking the
                    "part time soldiers," the <orgName ref="#natguard">National Guards</orgName>,
                    from more than 25,000 scattered homes.</p>
                <p>But the tale of how dough-boys of the division began to watch for their sign in
                    the heavens, and how it really became to them the "bow of promise" on the
                    battlefields of <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName> is a story which is not
                    so well known. That, like all traditions, grew. It grew behind that curtain of
                    censorship which kept <orgName ref="#gw-military">the enemy</orgName> unadvised
                    of the torrent of men and munitions <placeName ref="#xxu">America</placeName>
                    was speeding into <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName>, and behind that
                    curtain which likewise kept fond hearts at home from knowing just all that their
                    boys were doing to free the world from a hateful system.</p>

                    a beginning.</p>
                <p>Perhaps no spring has been more dreaded or awaited with more breathless

                <p>So the spring was dreaded because of new horrors it held in store. It was waited
                    for because the <orgName ref="#aef">Americans</orgName> would be there in force
                    to put their shoulders to the wheel and to lighten the grievous burden. It was
                    hoped for because it would bring relief from the suffering of winter trench
                    warfare.</p>
                <p>When warm showers and bright sunshine began to replace the blighting cold and
                    rain and 1eaden skies, when warm breezes once more wafted downy white breakers
                    across the blue sea of heaven and gently awoke the world, they found the
                        <orgName ref="#div42">42nd American Division</orgName> holding a sector in
                    the <geogName ref="#fr-vmt">Vosges mountains</geogName>, but a few hundred yards
                    from the border of <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName>'s lost <placeName
                        ref="#fr-lor">Lorraine</placeName>. The <orgName ref="#div42"
                        >Division</orgName> had been there since mid-winter, and war seemed to be a
                    drab sort of catastrophe as viewed from these thinly held mountains with their
                    occasional raids and minor battles, but continuous mud, snow and rain. </p>
                <p>It was whispered about that an attack was to be made, as is always the case no
                    matter how much secrecy is observed in preparations for the action. Those who
                    were in support saw long, dim, creaking lines of artillery and ammunition come
                    stealthily up the roads under cover of night and disappear before morning under
                    natural and artificial camouflage. Before many days had passed every clump of
                    trees in the rear area of the sector was bristling with guns and shells and men
                    all waiting. Finally the day came and at the appointed hour all the masked guns
                    leapt into action. For hours the air was filled with <choice>
                        <sic>screaching</sic>
                        <corr>screeching</corr>
                    </choice> steel. The earth trembled at the continued explosions that scratched
                    and tore at its face with <choice>
                        <sic>venemous</sic>
                        <corr>venomous</corr>
                    </choice> claws. </p>
                <p>With dawn there came the promise of a smiling sun after the drizzle of the long
                    thunderous night. And with it <q>H</q> hour. Out of their crumbling sloppy
                    trenches clambered the <orgName ref="#aef">doughboys</orgName> at the signal.
                    They moved forward through openings in the tangled masses of barbed-wire and
                    spread out behind the awesome curtain of the creeping barrage.</p>
                <p>Suddenly one of the bent-over, intent, jogging figures looked up and ahead and
                    saw that the first rays of the rising sun had painted a rainbow across the
                    receding clouds. <q>Look!</q> he shouted to his neighbor runner and somehow
                    getting his attention above all the crash of artillery and sharp sputter of
                    machine guns pointed to what he had seen.</p>
                <p>Odd as it may seem that such a commonplace thing as a rainbow would draw
                    attention in the midst of such stern business, the word passed up and down the
                    line of crouching runners and all took a moment to look. But the first line
                    trench of <orgName ref="#gw-military">the enemy</orgName> was at hand. After a
                    few moments of brisk hand-to-hand fight- <pb facs="image016" />
                    <fw n="3" place="top-right" type="pageNum">3</fw>
                    <fw place="top-center" type="header">The Rainbow</fw>ing with the outposts left
                    to hinder the raid, the line swept on toward the rainbow and the second and
                    third defenses of <orgName ref="#gw-military">the enemy</orgName>. At last the
                    mission of the attack was completed. Prisoners were taken, documents captured
                    and fortifications leveled. So full of enthusiasm were the raiders, however,
                    that it was with reluctance that they retraced their steps at the command. </p>
                <p>Back again in their own trenches the story of the rainbow leading the attack was
                    passed around. Before the end of the day it had been told and retold to every
                    man in the Division.</p>
                <p>Spring had merged into summer. The mightiest effort of the <orgName
                        ref="#gw-military">Hun hordes</orgName> was stemmed and the flood began to
                    recede, slowly at first and then more and more quickly as confidence waned and
                    the lines were thinned by the storms of steel. <date when="1918-07">One day in
                        late July</date> the <orgName ref="#div42">Rainbow Division</orgName> was

                    days it had been fighting against tremendous odds in those tangled woods and
                    across those golden and red fields of wheat and poppies. By wild charge, by
                    stealthy advance it had captured nests of machine gunners entrenched, or perched
                    in trees. Against two <q>invincible</q> Prussian Guard divisions it had steadily
                    advanced to the foot of <placeName ref="#hill212">Hill 212</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Here was the deadlock. Backward and forward the lines swayed as a height was
                    taken or a village captured, lost and won again within the space of a few hours.
                        <placeName ref="#hill212">Hill 212</placeName> was a strategic point and
                    must be taken before the troops could advance and wipe out the threatening
                    salient. Artillery was brought up and the attack planned. The hour came. As the
                    tired waves of men began their leaping, falling, crawling, halting advance
                    towards the crest, an astonishing phenomenon appeared. Clouds that had soaked
                    the earth during the night parted, and across the wooded crest of the hill was
                    brilliantly etched the Bow of Promise. It was a promise of Victory. The fighters
                    forgot their fatigue horror and hardships of the past weeks. With a wild cheer
                    they burst into a fierce charge. <q>The Rainbow! The Rainbow!</q> they shouted,
                    and again the familiar <q>Heaven, Hell or <placeName ref="#nju-hob"
                            >Hoboken</placeName> before Christmas.</q> All waves swept on and up in
                    the face of showers of bullets and <choice>
                        <sic>schrapnel</sic>
                        <corr>shrapnel</corr>
                    </choice>, and they captured the heights without faltering. And again the story
                    was told of how the battle-sky had held aloft the emblem of victory.</p>
                <p>In <date when="1917-09">September</date> the division moved up from a short rest

                <p>With the break of day, <q>H</q> hour struck and the <orgName ref="#armus">First
                        American Army</orgName> began its first independent offensive. Its purpose
                    was to nip off the troublesome <orgName ref="#stms"><placeName ref="#fr-stm">St.
                            Mihiel</placeName> salient</orgName> that so long had thrust its nose

                        >Verdun</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Clumsy looking but, agile, little whippet tanks appeared here and there and
                    crawled out nosing for trouble. The artillery that had been pounding away since
                    midnight at German wire, front trenches communications, batteries, and back
                    areas, now laid down its protective barrage and the brown lines of infantry
                    spread out in ragged formation.</p>
                <p>By this time the story of how the rainbow came to lead the successful attacks of
                    the division had become a cherished legend in the hearts of the <orgName
                        ref="#aef">doughboys</orgName>. There was little promise of a rainbow to
                    guide them that day for they had had no glimpse of the sun in more than two
                    weeks of dreary, sloppy night marches. And the next day was to be <date
                        when="1918-09-13">Friday the 13th</date>. The boys were depressed.</p>
                <p> But the sign came. As the first defenses were taken and the lines moved forward,
                    snipping their way through acres of tangled barbed-wire and running from cover
                    to cover toward the sheer sides of <placeName ref="#fr-mts">Mont
                    Sec</placeName>, the sun broke through the clouds. Across the western horizon
                    was flung in all its vivid colors the insignia of the fighting division. It was
                    the good omen. The mountain was surrounded captured, and the march
                    continued.</p>
                <p>No one has yet satisfactorily explained the last appearance of the colors in the
                    sky before the signing of the armistice. It was just prior to the final phase of
                    the <placeName ref="#fr-meu">Meuse</placeName> offensive. <orgName ref="#aef"
                        >The Americans</orgName> were waiting to burst across the <choice>

                        ref="#gw-military">the enemy</orgName>. The whole division was at the time
                    hiding in the rain-soaked, dripping <geogName ref="#fr-arg">Argonne
                        forest</geogName>, awaiting the word to advance to the forward
                    positions.</p>
                <p>One morning the sun appeared and drove every cloud from the sky. It was one of
                    those warm, clear autumn days of <date notAfter="1918-10-15"
                        notBefore="1918-10-01">early October</date>. In the course of the morning a
                    great aeroplane circled lazily over the woods which hid the division· It was
                    apparently aimlessly patrolling the sky. In its wake it left a long, sinuous
                    streamer of white smoke which scarcely moved from the spot where it was left, so
                    motionless was the air. And on this smoke a band of rainbow hues appeared.</p>
                <pb facs="image018" />

                <fw place="top-center" type="header">The Rainbow</fw>
                <p>There is very little that escapes the notice of a great concentration of troops
                    that have nothing to do but stay hidden. It was not long until someone had spied
                    out the colors. Within a few minutes 28,000 pairs of eyes had beheld the sign
                    and lusty throats began to shout. It was the prevalent opinion that the
                    appearance of the colors foretold that the division was to be called upon at
                    once to come to grips with the <orgName ref="#gw-military">Boches</orgName>.</p>
                <p>Strangely enough all elements of the famous unit were in the lines within a week.
                    Across the German stronghold, the <geogName ref="#fr-ks"
                        >Kremhilde-Stellung</geogName>, the <orgName ref="#aef">Yankees</orgName>
                    battled their way and won the great race to <placeName ref="#fr-sed"
                        >Sedan</placeName>. The official American communique stated on November 9th:
                            <q><orgName ref="#div42">The Rainbow Division</orgName> and units of
                            <orgName ref="#div1">the First Division</orgName> have captured that
                        part of <placeName ref="#fr-sed">Sedan</placeName> lying on the west side of

                        the city.</q></p>
                <p>Once more the rainbow made its appearance to the division. This time it was not
                    before a battle nor during a battle. It was on the afternoon of the <date
                        when="1918-12-16">16th of December, 1918</date>, as <orgName ref="#div42"
                        >the Rainbow Division</orgName> completed the last lap of its memorable
                    march to <geogName ref="#fr-rhi-riv">the Rhine</geogName>. To the strains of
                    martial music the tired columns of <orgName ref="#aef">doughboys</orgName>
                    rounded the last curve in the <geogName ref="#fr-vala">valley of the
                        Ahr</geogName> and came within sight of <geogName ref="#fr-rhi-riv">the
                        Rhine</geogName>. Just then a magnificent rainbow spanned the valley from
                    the ruins of <placeName ref="#dra-castle">Drachenfels castle</placeName> to the
                    heights on the south side of the river. The war was won. The last objective had
                    been reached and so appeared the emblem of success·</p>
                <p>The average American will tell you that he is not superstitious. But you would
                    have a mighty hard time convincing any doughboy of <orgName ref="#div42">the
                        Rainbow Division</orgName> that the appearances of the emblem were mere
                    coincidences. They were more than that he will tell you. They were omens of
                    victory.</p>
                <p>But it is not of the division, as such, with which this history deals. It must
                    treat of but one phase of its activities. It is of the blood-red ray of the bow
                    that we would speak, of the red cross of mercy as borne on the fields of France
                    by the <orgName ref="#st117">117th Sanitary Train</orgName>. It is our purpose
                    to give an accurate account of the formation, training and activities of the
                    train as a whole and of each unit of it, to serve not as a contribution to
                    literature but as a lasting record of events which might otherwise become
                    blurred or effaced from our book of memory as years pass.</p>

                    doubtful if the coming events had cascast much shadow on a certain little
                        <placeName ref="#nyu-lon-city">Long Island City</placeName>, long
                    sequestered from the rush and roar of modern American life. <placeName
                        ref="#nyu-hem">Hempstead Village</placeName>, as it was politically called,
                    had existed only in so far as it occupied a place on the map,&#8212;no less and
                    little more. The residents seeming to be content to live and to let live,
                    revered with true pride the rich blessings of Nature's choicest landscapes and
                    the glory of time honored associations. </p>
                <p>Indeed, the old colonial manner of life was preferred. It was like a trip into
                    Yesterday, to stroll along the splendid avenues so magnificently shadowed by the
                    stately elms and maples, or to drop into the historic little Episcopalian
                    chapel, whose charter had been granted by <persName ref="#queenanne">Queen
                        Anne</persName>. One could almost see the early days of <placeName
                        ref="#xxu">America</placeName>'s history, with the Indian encampments, where
                    crafty redskins bartered in wampum, hides, furs and feathers. Had <persName

                    cholerically down a street there, no one would have been greatly surprised. Such
                    was <placeName ref="#nyu-hem">Hempstead Village</placeName> in <date
                        notAfter="1917-08-15" notBefore="1917-08-01">early August, 1917</date>. It
                    is very doubtful if many people other than New Yorkers had ever previously heard
                    of the place, or of <placeName ref="#campmills">Camp Albert L.

                    destined to become a great national mobilization point. </p>
                <p>Then somebody suddenly realized that there was a war on hand. The newspapers had
                    been conveying the intelligence for several months, but to all appearances
                        <placeName ref="#nyu-hem">Hempstead</placeName> was but mildly interested in
                    the coming of her guests. No sooner had a few <orgName ref="#aef">O. D.
                        men</orgName> investigated the possibilities of the great camp site on the

                    hundreds of <orgName ref="#natguard">National Guardsmen</orgName>, the first
                    elements of the <orgName ref="#div42">42nd Infantry Division</orgName>, began to
                    gather in the village and camp. Gradually, day by day, and hour by hour, was
                    assembled the first complete, fully equipped National Guard Division in the

                <p>The rough spots in the <placeName ref="#nyu-nas">Nassau County</placeName> roads
                    soon became polished under the tramp of marching feet; the bray of the Army mule
                    vied with the song of the meadow-lark, the crow, and the bugle, to sound the
                    spirit of the crisp autumnal mornings; the heavy, ponderous combat wagons
                    rumbled along the turnpikes, </p>

                    pedestrian beset with peril. The theatres were jammed, the merchants waxed fat
                    on spot cash sales, the traction system never knew such prosperity,&#8212;in
                    short, <placeName ref="#nyu-hem">Hempstead</placeName> awoke from its Rip Van

                <p> No microscope was necessary to analyze the colors present in the military
                    spectrum. Infantry blue and artillery red, engineer cardinal and the maroon of
                    the medical department were readily discernable in the riot of activity and
                    color which prevailed on every hand. To form these maroon rays, eight companies
                    had been assembled from the length and breadth of land. In the response to

                    from the wide prairies of <placeName ref="#neu">Nebraska</placeName>, from the

                <p> Toward this rendezvous on <placeName ref="#nyu-lon">Long Island</placeName>
                    there had steamed forth into the rising sun long trains packed from end to end
                    with boisterous youths and eager men with shining eyes and light hearts setting

                    established an exhaustive series of exercises, drills, hikes, and lectures were
                    taken up. Nothing that was at that time considered essential to the maximum
                    efficiency of the trained medical men, was left untouched. The <pb

                    <fw place="top-center" type="header">Camp Mills</fw> instruction included
                    everything from first-aid in all practical forms and infantry drill to litter
                    drills, ward, pryamidal and shelter tent pitching, calesthenics, sanitation, the
                    care and use of the equipment and including the why and wherefore of the new
                    medical belt. It seemed to the men as though no hour of the day was left vacant.
                    Espseially was this true with the ambulance companies, who were thoroughly
                    inspired with the idea that an ambulance man must be part doctor, part chauffeur
                    and part soldier.</p>
                <p>The Saturday morning inspections were minute and thorough. Preparations for such
                    usually began on Friday afternoons when every bit of debris was carefully
                    interred or disposed of, the ground raked, scoured and swept and the equipment
                    shined and cleaned until the vicinity ot the sanitary train gounds radiated like
                    the rainbow itself. Three times a week all the tents were furled in order that
                    the air might circulate freely and at least partly evaporate the numbing
                    dampness of the enclosures</p>
                <p>The sanitary methods in vogue around the train camp site were of the best. Any
                    hour of the day or night a man might take a cold shower bath in the tapestried
                    enclosures at the end of the respective streets. Rigid daily inspections were

                    </choice> model spotless kitchens which were completely screened to keep out the
                    flies. Running water was at hand just outside the door. All garbage was either
                    buried or burned in makeshift incinerators nearby. Hence the general health of
                    the sanitary train being constantly safeguarded, the number of men answering
                    sick call was very small. A slight indisposition for a day or so after the
                    injection of typhoid and paratyphoid prophylaxsis was not considered as
                    illness.</p>

                    old style haversack, leather belt, corps pouch and non-comm's medical case went
                    into the discard. In their place the "U" roll came into favor along with
                    hatchets, individual medical pouch belts, a canteen and cup shaped to fit the
                    hip and various other "improvements." Alas, for the medical belt; its use has
                    always mroe theoretical than practical. The bandages stuck together like glue
                    and a week's sojourn in the tents so mildewed their medication that they soon
                    became useless. It was next to impossible to remove them from their tight
                    pockets. As for the hatchet, not a man breathes who had been dodging shells and

                <p>soldier-like manner. Furthermore, the belt was a nuisance to the ambulance
                    drivers who, in the cramped space at their disposal in the car, had practically
                    no room in which to groan, much less to wear the things. The <orgName

                    extenuation of the army medical belt.</p>
                <p> Inroads on the numbers of the personnel, as deemed expedient in the modern
                    scheme of war, early manifested themselves. Instead of the man being cemented to
                    his unit as in previous crises, he was frequently automatically severed from his
                    affiliations and sent to school, transferred to another company, or sent away on
                    special duty.</p>

                    and silence golden, and incidentally how to behave in a French billet. The men
                    were led to believe that, although things would be somewhat different overseas,
                    their quarters were to be choice, commodious and comfortable&#8212;a home away
                    from home. The subject of cooties, bleak and frigid barns, and fragrant manure
                    piles so dear to the heart of the French villagers, was avoided. It was taken
                    for granted that experience and self-reliance would be the best teacher when the
                    time came. If at times the meat in the lectures grew at all dry, the men never
                    tired to watch the intrepid airmen overhead. To most of the personnel such
                    exhibitions were something new, as one or two at a time were all that had been
                    visible in the life lived before.</p>
                <p>Many were the diversions in the ritual of the encampment as the weeks slipped by.
                    Baseball claimed the attention of ardent players and a dozen fast, snappy games
                    were played. An attempt to organize a league was made, but, owing to the lack of
                    athletes in several units, and the short time at the train's disposal, only a
                    few inter-company games were staged. An exhibition game between the <orgName

                        City</placeName>, was a treat for the train members to see.</p>
                <p>A pay day arrived one Sunday, with its attendant shirt-tail parade around camp in
                    the gloaming, to the martial music of questionable bugles enlivened by fire

                <p>the shooting up of the Robbers' Row of canteens. It was all as spectacularly
                    staged as in the wild and wooly days of <date when="1849">1849</date>. A storm
                    second to none from the standpoint of fury didn't lessen the dampness of the
                    island in the least, and the sanitary train will never forget that night of

                    descended and made the campsite more like a Venetian city than dry land.</p>
                <p>Ever a source of pleasure to the men of the train was the gracious hospitality of
                    the <orgName ref="#pplli">Long Islanders</orgName> who extended every courtesy

                    became the meccas of attractions for a large percentage of the medical men. Such
                    cordiality was better felt than expressed. It is more than probable that it was
                    in the spacious reception parlors of the <orgName ref="#redcross">American Red
                        Cross</orgName> in <placeName ref="#nyu-hem">Hempstead</placeName> that many
                    of the men partook of the last slice of honest to goodness cake ever tasted
                    until their European experiences were lived and ended.</p>
                <p>Sundays were quiet days in camp as the men were usually out to dinner, in quest
                    of various and sundry amusements, or enjoying 24 hours of freedom in <placeName
                        ref="#nyu">New York City</placeName>. What had been but a tale or a
                    descriptive article in the popular magazine or book a few months before became a
                    sparkling reality as the soldiers saw the sights and the attractions of that
                    great metropolis. </p>
                <p>The experiences encountered during such pilgrimages will long loiter in the minds
                    of the then unsophisticated westerners. <placeName ref="#nyu-brd"

                <p>As West mixed with East, in mercenary ways and customs, many amusing incidents
                    arose which, while binding the ties, nevertheless amused members of the sanitary
                    train, greatly. One youthful medical soldier related that he was addressed by a
                    middle-aged woman in a <placeName ref="#nyu-hem">Hempstead</placeName>
                    confectionery store as follows:</p>

                    soldiers' pockets for commodities, some considered it a good way to get
                    even.</p>
                <p><placeName ref="#campmills">Camp Mills</placeName> was ever and anon a sea of
                    rumors. Nothing seemed too wild or increditable for the soldierly appetite. For
                    a time the sugar-coated information perculated through the usual channels, that
                    the <orgName ref="#div42">Rainbow Division</orgName> had been recently inspected
                    by a <q type="soCalled">Lieut. Gen. Mogull</q> and found unfit for foreign
                    servie. Furthermore, as a result of his findings, the sanitary train was to be
                    sent south, probably to <placeName ref="#cu">Cuba</placeName>, to train for the
                    winter. There was no mistaking the ultimate destination of the train, when on
                        <date when="1918-09-20">September 20</date>, <persName ref="#wpchalfant">Lt.
                        William P. Chalfant</persName> of <orgName ref="#comnju">New

                    sailed for <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName> with the division's advance
                    party. </p>
                <p>Yet the men forgot that fact two days later when <placeName ref="#gw"
                        >Germany</placeName> and <placeName ref="#au">Austria</placeName> staged one
                    of their celebrated fake pleas for peace. The men accepted it at face value with
                    a howl of joy which swept through the camp like a chip on a flood tide's crest.
                    Next the <orgName ref="#unkqm">Q. M.</orgName> sergeants began to mark boxes of
                    supplies <q type="soCalled">Arizona.</q> The busybodies didn't stop to consider
                    that such was a code word to fool Hun spies, but immediately began to enlarge
                    the idea that the division was due for Border service. Visions of sand fleas,
                    scorpions, rattlesnakes, heat, dust and abominations of that arid region didn't
                    cheer the men's spirits in the least; for with the exception of <orgName
                        ref="#comoru">Oregon</orgName>, all the units had endured such a life the
                    previous winter. Eventually, however, when the letters A. E. F. were added,
                    foolishness took on a more somber tone. Belief and spread of these harmless
                    rumors really served as a sort of patriotic camouflage to the facts in the case,
                    in as much as the men were busy with foolishness when they might have been
                    jabbering on dangerous facts. They obscured the positive order that <orgName
                        ref="#div42">the Rainbow</orgName> was preparing as rapidly as possible for
                    that mysterious country, <q type="spoken">Somewhere in <placeName ref="#fr"

                <p>Towards the middle of <date when="1917-10">October</date>, a certain definite
                    belief that the division was about to move, took hold of the members of the
                    train. A second physical examination was given with special emphasis directed
                    towards sound hearts and lungs. A few physical defectives were eliminated from
                    the personnel by this examination. Some of them had already registered for the
                    selective draft and were subsequently inducted into the service again. <persName

                <p>Officer's trunks and barracks were crammed with extra clothing, shoes and little
                    luxuries to cheer the residents overseas. Cots were stacked in the kitchen. The
                    substantial long overcoats with their silken linings were exchanged for the
                    short flimsy kind, about as warm as B. V. D.'s on a January night, a last
                    strenuous inspection held, and the numbers of berths aboard a transport, doled
                    out. When the men were finally confined to their company streets and not even
                    pemitted to roam over to Robber's Row to put a dessert on dinner, something was
                    undoubtedly in the air. Postcards to be mailed by the government, <q

                    written and handed to the proper custodian. Some of these cards were actually
                    delivered.</p>
                <p>The soaring aeroplanes continued to fascinate spare moments, as one wondered how

                    morning hike was in progress. It was ; but a much longer hike than one so

                <p>There were no bands playing as, with full equipment the personnel of the eight

                <p>Over at the docks in <placeName ref="nju-hob">Hoboken, N. J.</placeName>, were
                    seven ships, awaiting the arrival of a cargo new to them. They were all old
                    vessels, having seen service before the war with the Hamburg-American Line. But
                    as they had been Hun property, they had been interned by the <placeName

                    under articles of International Law. When hostilities opened between the

                        >Germany</placeName>, the ships were seized and converted into transports.
                    Repairs were made and the necessary remodeling was done, but at that, they were
                    in poor condition and their American crews were kept busy repairing one thing or
                    another during the entire voyage. The names of these German freighters were
                    changed for patriotic American names which were: "<q>Covington,</q>
                    <q>President Lincoln,</q>

                    divided among these seven transports. The escort consisted of the cruiser
                    "Seattle" and two destroyers, making ten ships in all in the Rainbow fleet. Two

                    airecastles were demolished when ship officers led the way across the gun deck
                    and down innumerable ladders, into the hold, one or two decks below the water
                    line.</p>
                <p>It did not take long, however, for everyone to settle down to circumstances.
                    After squeezing and maneuvering through the narrow passages between the
                    three-tier canvas bunks, packs were disposed of by hanging them on water pipes
                    and similar furnishings. True soldiers were the men of the sanitary train, so as
                    soon as the doors of the mess halls were opened there was a grand rush.

                    American bananas it had carried.</p>
                <p>As fast as the transports were loaded they were towed into the channel, slowly
                    making their way out past the <placeName ref="#nyu-sol">Statue of
                        Liberty</placeName> to <geogName ref="#nju-san">Sandy Hook</geogName>. Many
                    eyes were peering through port holes and hatchways and many minds were wondering
                        <q>how long?</q> when the ships glided silently past the illuminated statue.
                    Some even went without supper to take that parting glance and M. P.'s showed a
                    soft spot in their hearts by allowing a few to stand on deck during these last
                    precious minutes of fast gathering darkness over the homeland.</p>
                <p>Everyone was tired and sleepy after the strain of the first day was over. No time
                    was lost in making regulation beds on the narrow and short canvass bunks. The
                    bunks were about the same on all the transports, being in tiers of three, with
                    only a scant eighteen inches between them. The third story man had the advantage
                    inasmuch as he was on top. Those having life belts <pb facs="image032" />

                    as such, and it was not long before the sonorous Jazz of sleeping men was all
                    that could be heard; except now and then someone would say in a stifled voice,
                        <q type="spoken">Take your feet out of my face, will you!</q> or <q
                        type="spoken">Say, Buck, will you remove your toe from my ear?</q></p>
                <p>At <date when="1917-10-19T15:00:00">three o'clock on the morning of October
                        19</date>, anchors were weighed and the seven transports began their voyage
                    towards <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName>. Only a few were awakened by the
                    clank of the anchor chains and the chugging of the engines. When the ship's
                    electrician turned on the lights in the hold, announcing that the sun was up
                    outside, and the familiar <q type="spoken">Heave to, and lash 'em up</q> brought
                    the sleepers to consciousness, the ships were steadily rolling, and those who
                    rushed up the hatchway to the deck, saw nothing but the green water of the
                        <geogName ref="#atlantic">Atlantic</geogName> and the rising sun. The first
                    man on deck <q type="term">braced</q> a hard looking sailor with the inevitable
                    question:</p>
                <lg>
                    <l><q type="spoken">How far are we from land?</q></l>
                    <l><q type="spoken">Three miles,</q> was the reply.</l>
                    <l><q type="spoken">Which direction?</q></l>
                    <l><q type="spoken">Straight down.</q></l>
                </lg>
                <p>Deck space was limited and the soldiers were plentiful. Each ship carried about
                    two regiments. So each organization was allowed to go on deck at certain
                    specified hours during the day, according to a schedule worked out by the
                    ranking officers on the various ships. The average for an organization was two
                    hours out of every twenty-four, but there were many who systematically worked
                    out methods of staying up most of the time. Some even slept on the upper decks,
                    perhaps feeling safer there than three flights down.</p>
                <p>Ventilation in the hold was a difficult problem, as the ships were originally
                    designed for freighters and were never meant to foster life below the first deck
                    down, where the crew slept. The regular ventilating systems of the ships were
                    ample for the first deck with its lounging rooms, mess halls and seamen's
                    quarters, but the compartments below the water line were airtight and dark, and
                    those next to the engine rooms were hot as ovens. Auxiliary canvas ventilators
                    were rigged up but even then it was stuffy and hot and many of the men lay on
                    their bunks during the long evenings and nights, in the uniforms issued by
                    Mother Nature. Owing to the bad air and crowded conditions, a ban on smoking in
                    the steerage compartments at any time was put on after the first night.</p>
                <p>Days and nights passed very slowly, especially the night, for lights were turned
                    out at the first appearance of twilight and <pb facs="image033" />
                    <fw n="18" place="top-left" type="pageNum">18</fw>
                    <fw place="top-center" type="header">Iodine and Gasoline</fw> smoking was
                    prohibited on deck after dark, leaving nothing for the soldiers to do but sleep.
                    These were necessary precautions for the protection of the men. On the second
                    day out, all matches, flashlights, and lighters were collected by the company
                    officers to make certain the orders were obeyed in regard to smoking. A thousand
                    or more glowing ends of cigarettes and cigars would make a splendid target for a
                    "U" boat. </p>
                <p>Peculiar ailments in the regions of the digestive organs began to appear among
                    the train members on the second day at sea. A few took refuge on their bunks and
                    in one or two cases, scarcely ever left them. The odor of "slum" and other foods
                    in the mess halls made those places the chief scenes of disorder. The sufferers
                    were a sorry lot and to some a torpedo from a German sub would have been
                    welcomed. All in all, they became firm believers that <persName ref="#ccolumbus"
                        >Columbus</persName> was a brave man and shook hands with themselves for not
                    enlisting in the navy. Most of the cases obtained their sealegs and recovered
                    rapidly while a few were unable to appreciate life throughout the entire voyage. </p>
                <p>A good example of <orgName ref="#gw-military">Hun</orgName> efficiency came to
                    light the third day out, when the <q>President Grant</q> developed boiler
                    trouble and began to lag behind. Even though all boats had been pronounced
                    seaworthy after their trial trip, some clever German engineer had removed a
                    minor part, calculated to disable the ship in midocean. On the evening of the
                    fourth day, it was finally decided that the "Grant" was unable to run the danger
                    zone, so with a good-bye toot of her whistle, she turned her prow towards
                        <placeName ref="#nyu">New York</placeName>, taking <orgName ref="#secam"

                        ref="#comneu">Nebraska</orgName> with her. </p>
                <p>It was a great disappointment to these members of the <orgName ref="#st117"
                        >sanitary train</orgName>, for visions of <placeName ref="#e"
                        >Europe</placeName> and the battle fields were temporarily shattered and the
                    train was scattered for the first time since its organization. The <q>Grant</q>
                    docked at <placeName ref="#nju-hob">Hoboken</placeName> on the <date

                        October 27</date>, and the troops were sent to neighboring camps to await
                    their second attempt to cross. </p>
                <p><q type="soCalled">Abandon ship</q> drills were inaugurated early in the trip.
                    Orders required each man to carry a blanket and a canteen full of water besides
                    wearing his overcoat and life preserver, when attending these drills.
                    Instructions were issued in detail about what to do if the ship was actually
                    abandoned. Everyone was assigned to either a life boat or a raft. Rafts were
                    plentiful and were set apart for the use of enlisted men. Each company was
                    assigned a spot on the gun deck, and whenever the alarm sounded, every man went
                    to his company's rendezvous promptly, taking pains neither to hurry nor to
                    loiter on his way. Nobody ever knew when the alarm sounded whether it was
                    genuine or only a <pb facs="image034" />
                    <fw n="19" place="top-right" type="pageNum">19</fw><fw place="top-center"
                        type="header">Voyage</fw> practice drill. If a man loitered he ran a risk of
                    missing his raft. If he ran he was subject to being shot for starting a
                    stampede. Consequently these drills were carried out with good speed and
                    precision. Excitement ran high at such times, for imagination works strongly and
                    it was always a relief when orders were given to return to the compartments. Not
                    until then did any of the men know it was only a drill and during those short
                    moments, often with rain and waves sweeping the decks, all eyes were searching
                    the white-capped waves for periscopes.</p>
                <p>At first life belts were only to be kept handy, but after the danger zone was
                    entered they had to be worn or carried at all times. <q type="soCalled">Abandon
                        ship</q> drills came any hour of the day or night when least expected, and
                    sometimes twice or three times a day. Drills were not held while the convoy was
                    running the danger zone. In the moments of relaxation after the drills
                    conversation always ran high. One could hear on all sides remarks about
                    submarines, torpedoes, life belts, blankets, and various statements as to what
                    should be done in case the ship was torpedoed. Everybody wanted a boat instead
                    of a raft, for rafts were flimsy looking affairs and their occupants would be
                    waist deep in cold water. General opinion changed, however, for on an occasion
                    when the boats were lowered, the bottom fell out of one, the two sailors in
                    charge being saved by their swimming ability. The incident was one more example
                    of the subtle deviltry of the Hun. The boat had been put together with nothing
                    but glue. Following the event all of the boats and rafts were subjected to a
                    rigid inspection. The drills came to naught and the boats and rafts were never
                    used ; thanks to the good work of the navy. </p>
                <p>The cruiser and two destroyers were not the only protection the convoy had
                    against the stealthy submarine. Each transport was armed with one or more
                    six-inch guns and also with a few of smaller calibre. The guns were manned by
                    experienced crews taken from battleships. Even experienced as they were, target
                    practice was necessary in order that the gunners might be able to deal properly
                    with a sub if one made an appearance. A moving target, towed behind one of the
                    ships, and resembling a periscope, was used. The transports took their turns
                    firing and after these performances the men's fears somewhat subsided. Many
                    direct hits were scored and there were few shots that went wild. Keeping the
                    guns trained on the target in a rolling sea as those gunners did, was a
                    wonderful feat in itself. The practice was a rare sight to the soldiers for it
                    gave them an idea of war on the sea, especially when a cruiser fired a
                    broadside. Of the transports, the <q>De Kalb</q> was the most heavily armed,
                    carrying in all twenty-six guns. </p>

                <p>Life on the ocean was not without work or amusement. Washrooms, troop
                    compartments and mess halls had to be cleaned every day by details selected from
                    the personnel of the various organizations. <orgName ref="#unkkp">K.
                        P.</orgName>'s were not forgotten and a few enjoyed a sojourn in the
                    kitchens with the navy cooks. The navy medical personnel on one or two of the
                    transports was insufficient to care for both sailors and soldiers, so the train
                    furnished some of its more experienced wielders of the iodine swab to assist in
                    the sick bay. This was looked upon, more or less, as a <q type="soCalled">soft
                        job</q> for the red cross arm band permitted them to go to any part of the
                    vessel at any time. It was also a known fact that the sick bay was the only
                    place on board where a real thirst-quenching drink of water could be obtained. </p>
                <p>Time was heavy on the soldier's hands and he was thrown almost entirely on his
                    own resources for amusement. Whenever the weather permitted, band concerts were
                    held on the main deck, but these only occupied a short hour of the day.
                    Impromptu programs were sometimes given in the evenings. Every available book,
                    magazine and paper was carefully read by the pale blue light of the hold. Those
                    who were not inclined, or were not lucky enough to have something to read,
                    played cards, shot craps, or discussed the prospects held in store by the war.
                    Some of the more energetic, burled themselves in French grammars and hand books,
                    so that they would be able to <q type="foreign" xml:lang="fr">parlez vous</q>
                    when the voyage was finally ended and they were on solid ground again. Curiosity
                    led many of the bolder characters to explore the ship, visiting the many
                    compartments, store rooms and even gaining entrance to the engine rooms. When
                    nothing else could be done, the men lay on their bunks and slept. </p>
                <p>The two hours of breathing time on deck were taken up by attempts to run the
                    canteen line&#8212;a feat rarely accomplished&#8212;dodging the spray, making up
                    for lost smokes, and above all, searching the waves as far as the eye could see
                    for submarines or other vessels. Whenever a strange ship made an appearance, the
                    destroyers immediately investigated, and once when all guns were leveled on a
                    mysterious boat, everyone was on edge for <q>something doin'</q> until the
                    competent chasers signaled that all was well. Especially after the danger zone
                    was entered were all eyes strained for the sight of a periscope or the white
                    wake of an on-coming torpedo, but never were the searching glances rewarded. </p>
                <p>Day after day went by with no signs of ever getting anywhere. All there was to be

                <p>be sighted? Rumor had it that a large escort was to relieve the original one
                    which the men deemed inadequate. Every day someone heard that the convoy was to
                    join the fleet that night. Every morning coming on deck, all would look for the
                    missing destroyers. Fear began to spread that <orgName ref="#div42">the
                        Rainbow</orgName> had been forgotten and would have to face the dangers with
                    very little protection. The suddenly one morning, after all hope had been cast
                    overboard, the fleet was surrounded by eleven mysterious and grotesquely painted
                    crafts. They darted in and out, here and there, seemingly leaving no spot
                    uncovered in their nervous plungings. </p>
                <p>Here was a new diversion, for the ocean-weary soldiers, watching the pitching,
                    rolling, wildly daubed destroyers patrolling the sea. This was the first time
                    the men ever saw camouflage. Their arrival was soon accounted for when a
                        <q>sailor told a soldier</q> that during the previous night, the fleet had
                    almost run into a submarine nest, only being warned in time to change its
                    course, while the two destroyers gave chase.</p>
                <p>The feeling that land was not far away began to take hold of the troops and
                    visions of Sunny <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName> occupied their
                    imagination. Obliging sailors put out the information that the fleet was in the
                        <geogName ref="#fr-bay"><choice>
                            <sic>bay</sic>
                            <corr>Bay</corr>
                        </choice> of Biscay</geogName> and would soon be in sight of land. Much
                    wreckage, a life boat, several rafts and boxes were seen afloat. Seagoing
                    vessels could be sighted in the distance, gulls swarmed about the transports and
                    a general cleaning and inspection of troops' quarters took place. Still the
                    once-clean but now filthy life belts had to be worn at all times for it was said
                    that this was the most dangerous water of all that the fleet had passed over. </p>
                <p>On the morning of <date when="1917-10-31">October 31</date>, word was passed
                    below that land was in sight. In a few minutes the decks were crowded and heads
                    were protruding from every port hole, drinking in the welcome sight of <geogName
                        ref="#fr-bel">Belle Isle</geogName>. Everyone drew in a deep sigh of relief
                    as the fleet passed through the submarine nets between the mainland of
                        <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName> and <geogName ref="#fr-bel">Belle
                        Isle</geogName>. Life belts were thrown aside, and one by one the transports
                    entered the channel of the <geogName ref="#fr-lor-riv">Loire <choice>
                            <sic>river</sic>

                        </choice></geogName>. Thousands of small fishing boats dotted the water on
                    all sides. The channel was shallow and all the transports were heavily loaded,
                    so very little headway was made during the day, even with French pilots on
                    board. This only aggravated the already impatient men who were anxious to bid
                    farewell to transports and set foot on good hard ground once more. </p>
                <p>At <date when="1917-11-01T03:00:00">3 o'clock on the morning of November 1,
                        1917</date>, the six transports docked in a French seaport with the <orgName

                        >117th Sanitary Train</orgName>, as they gazed upon it from the decks of the
                    boats in which they had crossed the ocean. The land they saw was not dry,
                    either, for everywhere within vision was mud, and what they could not see was
                    hidden by the fog and mist that hung over the harbor at <placeName ref="#fr-stn"
                        >St. Nazaire</placeName> on <date notAfter="1917-11-01T12:00:00"
                        notBefore="1917-11-01T00:00:00">the morning of the first of November,
                        1917</date>. As has been told in the previous Chapter the last fourteen days
                    had been spent on the water, and the last four days in the zone of great U-boat
                    activity. The relief at finding themselves in the harbor, safe and sound was far
                    more luxurious feeling than the peace time traveler experiences even after his
                    first voyage. Every one of the men had heard and read a great deal about <q
                        type="soCalled">Sunny <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName></q>, and
                    although it was far from sunny that morning, they were glad to see it just the
                    same. </p>
                <p>The entire day was spent on the boats, and from the decks the men had their first
                    glimpse of <orgName ref="#gw-military">the Boche</orgName>,&#8212;a harmless,
                    domesticated type, commonly known <orgName ref="#gw-pg">P.G.'s</orgName>. They
                    were doing longshore work on the dock, unloading supplies belonging to the
                        <placeName ref="#xxu">U. S. A.</placeName>, and every box they handled was
                    bringing the German defeat just so much closer. In charge of the entire group of
                    about fifty, was one French guard, and he was much more interested in watching
                    the masses of O. D. clad soldiers over the rails of the transports, than in
                    keeping check on his prisoners. </p>
                <p>This guard was the first man seen wearing the horizon blue of the French, so
                    familiar to every member of the <orgName ref="#aef">A. E. F.</orgName> To the
                    men on the boats he was representative of the millions of brave Frenchmen, who
                    had fought, and were still fighting, for Right against a foe as merciless and
                    cunning as a famished wolf pack. He was one of the men whom they had crossed the
                    ocean to help; and they were glad they had come. </p>
                <p>In another place on the dock was a group of American negroes in the overall
                    uniform of the stevedores. They seemed to be enjoying life just as much as if
                    they had been on some Dixie wharf, handling cotton bales instead of unloading
                    munitions of war in <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName>. </p>

                <fw place="top-center" type="header">France</fw>

                <p>Here and there were stern looking American <orgName ref="#marus"
                        >Marines</orgName> doing general guard duty on the dock. <q type="soCalled"
                        >Hard boiled</q> was the word the boys employed in describing them. </p>
                <p>As soon as the civilian population of the city became aware that a new convoy of
                        <orgName ref="#pplus">Americans</orgName> had arrived, they flocked to the
                    water front. These were not the first <orgName ref="#pplus">Yanks</orgName> they
                    had seen, but the appearance of these boats, swarming with strong, sturdy, young
                    soldiers from a far-off land, arriving safely from a sea infested with German
                    U-boats, had not ceased to thrill and interest them. The men on the boats were
                    interested in the civilians, too, because they wanted to see and know more about
                    the people whom they had come so far to help. The most noticeable thing about
                    the crowd was the almost total absence of able-bodied men. The few who were
                    there were in uniform. The remainder of the crowd consisted of old men, women
                    and children. The women were all dressed in black, and many of the men wore
                    mourning bands on their arms. </p>
                <p>The water around the transports was crowded with small boats, loaded with
                    children, who begged souvenirs, and offered chocolate and apples for sale, and
                    many a service hat was lowered by means of a cord or rope, filled with many
                    apples or as much chocolate as the money in the hat would buy, and hauled back
                    up into the porthole. </p>
                <p>When evening came the impressions of <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName> in
                    the minds of the soldiers were strange and varied, but as they lay down on their
                    canvass bunks that night, every man was glad that he was there and proud to
                    think that he had volunteered to come. </p>
                <p>On the morning of the <date when="1917-11-02">2nd of November</date>, <orgName
                        ref="#commiu">Michigan</orgName> debarked from their boat and, leaving a
                    detail behind to take care of the company equipment as it was unloaded, they
                    marched through the city and out to what was known as <placeName ref="#camp1"
                        >Camp No. 1</placeName>, their first home in <placeName ref="#fr"
                        >France</placeName>. This camp was composed of French wooden barracks and
                    furnished shelter for approximately 1500 men. It was used for housing men who
                    came off the boats until transportation could be obtained to carry them inland.
                    Here the men had a chance to get rid of their sea legs, to bathe the salt crust
                    off their bodies, to wash their clothes, to replenish their supply of tobacco
                    and cigarettes and learn to count in francs and centimes. </p>
                <p>The same day, a detail was chosen to proceed inland and arrange for billets in
                    the towns where the train was to make its first home in <placeName ref="#fr"
                        >France</placeName>. One non-commissioned officer from each company formed
                    this advance party, in charge of <persName ref="#rccook">Captain Robert C.
                        Cook</persName> of <orgName ref="#comcou"><placeName ref="#cou"

                <fw place="top-center" type="header">Iodine and Gasoline</fw>
                <p>The other companies, <orgName ref="#comoku">Oklahoma</orgName>, <orgName
                        ref="#comdcu">D. C.</orgName>, <orgName ref="#comoru">Oregon</orgName> and
                        <orgName ref="#comcou">Colorado</orgName> were taken off the boat at
                    different times during the day, marched through the city to <placeName
                        ref="fr-oblvd">Ocean Boulevard</placeName> and there given a few minutes'
                    freedom for the purpose of stretching and exercising the legs and bodies that
                    had necessarily been idle for the last fifteen days. The boulevard was deep with
                    sloppy mud and the boys were wearing light barracks shoes, but they enjoyed it
                    just as if they had been on the finest lawn in the world. They were on land
                    again and they knew that no submarine could nose up under them and blow them all
                    into <q>kingdom come.</q> On the return trip to the boat, the companies marched
                    through the principal streets of the city, crooked, narrow streets to be sure,
                    but principal streets just the same. </p>
                <p> The city of <placeName ref="#fr-stn">St. Nazaire</placeName> is situated at the
                    mouth of the <geogName ref="#fr-lor-riv">Loire <choice>
                            <sic>river</sic>

                        </choice></geogName>, and until within the last 75 years was a small village
                    with a harbor that would accommodate only fishing vessels and boats engaged in
                    trade along the coast. At this time it was found that the ports of <placeName
                        ref="#fr-bre">Brest</placeName> and <placeName ref="#fr-bor"
                        >Bordeaux</placeName> were not large enough to handle all the shipping that
                    came to France from <geogName ref="#atlantic">the Atlantic</geogName>. To remedy
                    this the French government decided to make improvements at the mouth of
                        <geogName ref="#fr-lor-riv">the Loire</geogName>, so all but the largest
                    type of ocean craft could come into the harbor and be docked. During the time
                    these improvements were being made and after their completion, the population
                    was greatly increased and the city itself was built up. Properly speaking it is
                    not one of the oldest cities of <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName>, but to
                    these men from <placeName ref="#xxu">America</placeName> it seemed to be the
                    very superlative of all things old. </p>
                <p>The first evening all the men were held on boats, but on the following evening a
                    certain <choice>
                        <sic>per cent.</sic>
                        <corr>percent</corr>
                    </choice> of each company was granted shore leave and these men explored the
                    city in their way. They found a great difference from the things that they were
                    used to at home. The shops were all small, and, with the exception of those
                    handling military accouterments, very little display was made. It was almost
                    impossible to buy anything to eat except roasted chestnuts. There were a few
                    places where cheese sandwiches could be obtained, but they were more expensive
                    than chicken dinners in <placeName ref="#xxu">the States</placeName>, and as
                    most of the men had spent most of their entire month's pay on their last trip to
                        <placeName ref="#nyu">New York</placeName>, they invested in very few
                    sandwiches. The French people were all anxious to talk to the <orgName
                        ref="#aef">Americans</orgName> and it was then the men received their first
                    lesson in French. They learned that <q type="foreign" xml:lang="fr">bon soir</q>
                    meant <q>good evening</q>; that <q type="foreign" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</q>
                    meant <q>goodbye</q>, <q type="foreign" xml:lang="fr">bon chance</q> meant
                        <q>good luck</q>. If a Frenchman came up to a bunch of the boys and jabbered
                    something at them that <pb facs="image040" />
                    <fw n="25" place="top-right" type="pageNum">25</fw><fw place="top-center"
                        type="header">France</fw> they could not understand, they would all say <q
                        type="foreign" xml:lang="fr">oui, oui</q>. And that seemed to be the correct
                    answer, for he would usually start jabbering again, and at his second pause the
                    boys would repeat their vocabulary. Everyone seemed to enjoy their experience,
                    but many a man berated himself because he had not studied French instead of
                    German while in high school, and others because they had not taken French
                    lessons in the camps in the States. Everything was different from anything they
                    had ever seen before, but they liked it and started studying French at once.</p>

                        <corr>marches</corr>
                    </choice> and shore leaves were the things of most interest. Details were kept
                    on the docks to take care of equipment and barrack bags as they were unloaded
                    from the boat, and to handle the four days' rations that were issued to each
                    company. </p>

                        notBefore="1917-11-06T00:00:00">the 6th of November</date>, <orgName

                        1</placeName>, and boarded a train composed of third-class coaches. Eight
                    men were crowded into each compartment along with their personal equipment and
                    two days' travel rations. This left them scarcely any place to sit down and of
                    course lying down was out of the question. In the evening all the other
                    companies left the boat and splashed through mud to the railroad yards, in the
                    drizzling rain that had kept up, intermittantly, ever since their arrival in
                    port. A careful scrutiny of the yards showed nothing but box cars and everyone
                    thought that they would have to stand around in the rain until some passenger
                    coaches were pulled in. They were soon disillusioned, however, for they found
                    that they were to take the <q type="soCalled">8-40</q> train, so called because
                    each of the box cars was marked <q type="foreign" xml:lang="fr">Cheveaux 8,
                        Hommes 40</q>. To get forty men into one of these dinky cars, along with
                    their equipment and travel rations, meant that they must stand. There was no
                    room to sit or lie down. Evidently transportation was scarce. They crowded in,
                    piled their corned willy and hard tack in the middle of the floor, and made the
                    best of it. </p>
                <p>The train started at dark and moved slowly with frequent stops throughout the
                    night. At one halt, a so-called French coffee station, the men were each given a
                    cup full of villainous, black concoction closely resembling diluted furniture
                    polish. Its only redeeming feature was the fact that it was scalding hot and
                    that made it welcome to the men, who were wet and cold. There was no heat in the
                    cars, and the men, wet from the late march through the rain, became chilled to
                    the very marrow. For the first time since entering the service they were
                    thoroughly disgusted. </p>

                <p>When morning came, the sun showed itself for the first time since land was
                    sighted and everyone after exercising on the station platform during the
                    numerous stops, began to take a new interest in life. </p>
                <p>After the morning repast of cold canned tomatoes and hard tack, the discomforts
                    of the night were forgotten and the scenery occupied everyone's attention. On
                    every hand there was beautiful level valleys divided into a patchwork of plots,
                    and long sloping hills, terraced and cultivated to the very top. There were no
                    scattered farm houses as in <placeName ref="#xxu">America</placeName>, but every
                    few kilometers there was a small village of stone houses, red tiled roofs,
                    crooked streets, and small gardens, nestling against the hill. The most
                    prominent point in each village was its high-spired church. </p>
                <p>The second night on the train was not as bad as the first. The men had thoroughly
                    dried their clothes during the day, and some had opened their packs and had
                    taken out the blankets as extra protection from the cold.</p>
                <p>The iron rations were eaten with relish, for the men were not yet fed up on it.

                <p>The scenery the second day was virtually unchanged, except that the country was a
                    bit rougher and did not seem so well cultivated as that nearer the coast. The
                    villages, houses, and churches were all the same, the population apparently the
                    same as at <placeName ref="#fr-stn">St. Nazaire</placeName>. A few young men in
                    uniform, and all the rest old men, women and children.</p>
                <p><date when="1917-11-08T12:00:00">after noon on November 8</date>, the train

                    wind-swept sheds and cold bare rooms in houses, instead of the comfortable rooms
                    with feather beds that had been pictured to the boys. Both companies, however,
                    soon found that they had no time to spend in their billets except while
                    sleeping. Before leaving the train at <placeName ref="#fr-vau"
                        >Vaucouleurs</placeName> the men heard their first sounds of war the faint
                    rumble of artillery fire on the front between <placeName ref="#fr-tou"
                        >Toul</placeName> and <placeName ref="#fr-ver">Verdun</placeName>. Although
                    the sound was indistinct the men felt that they were at last nearing the object
                    of their search. They had traveled many thousands of miles and many days and at
                    last they had drawn close to the war. </p>

                <p>After two hours' delay the train moved on, and well after dark it arrived at

                        >Colorado</orgName>, had received their introduction to lofts and barns as
                    sleeping apartments. The strange places made no difference to the boys that
                    night, they were all so tired that any place where they could lie down and
                    stretch out was welcome as the best of beds.</p>
                <p> In the chill of the next morning, though, the red-roofed houses looked dingy and
                    dirty at close range, the crooked streets were sloppy, muddy, and lined with
                    piles of barnyard manure, reeking and steaming. The people showed evidence of a
                    soap famine. Even the sky was a dirty gray and promised more rain. The first
                    duty was to clean out the billets and try to make them habitable. Kitchen sites
                    were located and wood was "procured from the French. The men bathed or washed
                    clothes in French style, in cold water, with soap, brushes and wooden paddles.
                    These last articles were borrowed from French women washing nearby.</p>
                <p>There followed street cleaning. The populace did not understand why streets
                    should be cleaned, and very few of the men could speak French enough to explain
                    it. But they cleaned them just the same, and after a few days of hard labor the
                        <orgName ref="#aef">Americans</orgName> gave to the old town a much more

                    they started to clean it up. Hot water and vigorous scrubbing made it
                    serviceable at the end of two days' hard labor. An epidemic of mumps arose among
                    the <orgName ref="#st117">117th Engineers</orgName> who were in the same town as
                    the hospital section. With mumps and the ordinary sick, there were 74 patients

                    operating this hospital, they had cared for a total of 84 patients, a very
                    difficult task, owing to the lack of medical supplies and hospital

                    visited the ruins of an old castle, which was situated on the hill back of the

                    up and joined the column. Fortunately the roads were dry and the marching was
                    comparatively easy, as marching with a full pack goes. At <time when="12:00:00"

                    column moved on again. The afternoon was not so easy as the morning. The sun
                    seemed boiling hot. Pack straps began to chafe tired shoulders, blistered feet
                    became more painful and the attending ambulances soon became loaded. At dark the
                    column stopped at <placeName ref="#fr-msm">Maxey-sur-Meuse</placeName> and the
                    men were billeted in barns and lofts. <orgName ref="#comoru">Oregon</orgName>
                    and <orgName ref="#secam">the hospital headquarters</orgName> arrived ahead of
                    the main column, under the guidance of a company of M. P.'s who had been lost on

                    and an hour later it stopped at the roadside for lunch. All afternoon they

                <p>In the morning packs were rolled and the grounds were policed. The wagons had

                    had already marched out into the highway were called back. Packs were unslung
                    and policing started again. There were about 1000 men in the group and the
                    grounds were again gone over thoroughly, but still it did not please the chloric
                    officer, and he ordered it all done a third time. <q type="spoken">Pick up

                <p>Never did Germans hate British as the men of that column hated that picayunishly

                    divisional commander, drove up in his car and the officer responsible for
                    detaining the column was brought before him. Immediately after the General's car
                    rolled away the column moved out. They had been held for four hours on a trivial
                    pretext.</p>
                <p>This day's march was the hardest of the entire trip. The men were chilled and
                    miserable, for it had been raining nearly all the time that they had been
                    waiting. A company of <orgName ref="#aef">doughboys</orgName> without packs
                    headed the column and set a pace uphill a little slower than double time. After
                    reaching the top of this three-kilometer hill, the troops passed a section of
                    trenches and barbwire entanglements, one of the training sectors of the French.
                    The <orgName ref="#fr-military">French troops</orgName> drilling there stuck
                    their heads up and gazed, in wonderment and surprise, at the <orgName ref="#aef"

                <p>Dinner time came but no dinner. The kitchens had gone ahead according to their

                    few days and others spent time in the hospitals before they were able to go back
                    to duty. <placeName ref="#fr-stb">St. Blin</placeName> was juat as small and as
                    muddy as the average French village. Dingy old houses, dirty streets with the
                    inevitable pile of fertilizer, were its earmarks, and curious peasant
                    people.</p>
                <p>The train was quartered in draughty, thin-boarded Adrian barracks furnished with
                    wooden bunks that were new and clean. No bedding was furnished by the army, but
                    the boys were not long in finding a Frenchman who was willing to sell straw at
                    the rate of two francs per tick full, so they were able to make themselves
                    fairly comfortable after the first bike in France. The heating arrangements was
                    a small stove at one end of the long building, but it was so small and wood so
                    scarce that it was of virtually no use. The only way to keep warm during the
                    winter weather at <placeName ref="#fr-stb">St. Blin</placeName> was to go to

                    and after it came rain and sleet, leaving the ground and roads covered with a
                    solid sheet of ice. The mules were all smooth-shod and until some of them could
                    be reshod, it was almost impossible to draw rations for the companies.</p>
                <p>In spite of these weather conditions, a five-mile hike with full pack was

                    home, the letters being gathered, censored and sent ashore. After waiting there
                    forty-eight hours they joined the other ships of the convoy, nine in all, and
                    put out to sea. A British cruiser in the harbor paid the <orgName ref="#aef"
                        >Americans</orgName> a tribute by allowing her band to play the <q>Star
                        Spangled Banner</q> and the crew stood at attention as the convoy steamed
                    past.</p>
                <p>In spite of the bad weather the different organizations proceeded through a
                    regular schedule of physical exercises and lifeboat drill. The gunners on the

                    rendered by the <orgName ref="#sec168band"><orgName ref="#commiu">168th

                    days of the trip, had to be discontinued on entering the war zone.</p>
                <p>Due to the efforts of two <orgName ref="#ca-ymca">Canadian Y. M. C. A.</orgName>
                    secretaries, who were crossing, to join their troops at the front, several first
                    class entertainments were produced during the voyage. Among the best was a
                    minstrel show given by a few of the boys from <placeName ref="#nju">New

                <p>The English sailors could not understand many traits of American soldiers, above
                    all, how they could play poker and joke with such care-free actions when danger
                    was all around.</p>
                <p>When on <date when="1917-11-25">November 25</date>, the men were ordered to sleep
                    with their clothes and life belts on, it was easy to guess that the convoy had
                    reached the danger zone. <date when="1917-11-28">November 28</date> proved to be
                    the most exciting day of the journey, when something very similar to a periscope
                    made its appearance a short distance away and passed within a hundred yards of
                    the <q>Aurania.</q> The Sharpshooters who had been posted at different points on
                    the ship some time before, opened fire with rifles. The <q>Celtic</q>
                    immediately spun around, so as to present as small a target as possible, opening
                    fire with her stern guns. Two destroyers were immediately on the scene firing
                    perhaps a dozen shots in rapid succession. The alleged periscope disappeared,
                    and the fleet changed its course, putting into <placeName ref="#ie-bel"
                        >Belfast</placeName> harbor about dark. While the troop ships lay in the

                    incidents took place. The year <date when="1917">1917</date> was still alive.
                    The <orgName ref="#aef">American Expeditionary Force</orgName> in <placeName
                        ref="#fr">France</placeName> was still an experiment. The old methods of
                    handling an army, in force since the Spanish-American war, had not been altered
                    to fit the conditions of the greatest war the world had ever seen.</p>

                    </choice> to dwell upon the success of this <orgName ref="#aef">A. E.
                        F.</orgName> experiment. Such victories are not won in seclusion. Everybody
                    knows that <placeName ref="#xxu">America</placeName> built up the most wonderful
                    and efficient service of supply that ever existed, and kept alive an army on the
                    other side of the globe from her resources. But that was an accomplishment of
                    the next year. Until <date when="1917-12-25">Christmas, 1917</date>, much of
                    America's shipping facilities was still in the forest and mine. The wonderful
                    service of supply existed only on paper. The <orgName ref="#aef">American
                        fighting force</orgName> had everything to learn about modern warfare and
                    the French and British were still holding the line. </p>
                <p>The people in <placeName ref="#xxu">America</placeName> were contributing
                    lavishly and blindly of their money, only wondering what the outcome of this
                    experiment would be. The officers and men of the <orgName ref="#aef">A. E.
                        F.</orgName> in the meantime waited in their muddy French villages, also
                    wondering what the outcome would be, knowing that they were the material upon
                    which the experiment would be tried. And among them was the <orgName

                    men, it must be said that their dread of the coming march was not born of any
                    silk-stockinged mollycoddleism. It was evident that their present abodes were
                    not permanent, for deep as were the mysteries of army movements at that time,
                    the men knew that their ultimate destination lay much farther ahead, three or
                    four days' walking distance. </p>
                <p>If a great many of the men grumbled at the prospect of walking through country
                    netted by railroads, it was because they did not realize that the battle then
                    raging in <placeName ref="it">Italy</placeName> was taxing the French railroads
                    to their very limit. The two thousand cars necessary to transport the division

                        >America</placeName>'s war plans, like all new things, were subject to many
                    mistakes and subsequent corrections; and that they, who had come early, must
                    accept the consequences of the inevitable mistakes.</p>
                <p>For a few days previous to Christmas, rumors had been floating around, to the
                    effect that the train was to make a three-day hike. Consequently, at first call
                    for reveille everyone awakened expectantly on <date when="1917-12-27">the
                        morning of December 27</date>, just before dawn. It had been very cold, and
                    during the night five or six inches of snow had fallen. By the time everyone was
                    dressed, light of day had driven away the inky darkness of the night before. And
                    what a sight was presented to the eyes! The earth, building and every tree, were
                    enveloped in a great white blanket, such as only nature can provide. The air was
                    full of large feathery flakes, that were slowly descending to thicken that
                    blanket. </p>
                <p>Had the men been at home, with sleds and sleighs, this day would have been a
                    delightful one, but that little dream had to be banished. The hard fact that
                    this was <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName> and they were as yet not
                    acclimated, and a long hike was to begin in an hour, put an entirely different
                    interpretation on the picture without. </p>
                <p>The <orgName ref="#hqds"><persName ref="#jwgrissinger">Division
                            Surgeon</persName>'s office force</orgName> had fared luckier that the
                    train's personnel, for it had departed by truck for <placeName ref="#fr-rol"
                        >Rolampont</placeName> the day before, making the complete trip in a day.
                    Frost-bitten ears and fingers made the trip miserable enough for them, but when
                    compared with the pedestrian's experience, the trucks were palace cars.</p>
                <p><orgName ref="#secam">Ambulance section headquarters</orgName> and <orgName
                        ref="#secfh">fie1d hospital headquarters</orgName> hiked with the train,
                    enduring the hardships of those memorable days as best they could. Every company
                    was short of transportation and as a result, the few combat wagons available
                    were loaded to the breaking point, in some cases to be drawn by two smooth-shod
                    mules over roads that would have rendered an empty wagon a burden. </p>
                <p><date when="1917-12-27T08:00:00">A few moments after 8 o'clock</date>, <orgName
                        ref="#secam">ambulance section headquarters</orgName>, <orgName
                        ref="#comnju">Jersey</orgName>, <orgName ref="#comtnu">Tennessee</orgName>,
                    and <orgName ref="#comneu">Nebraska</orgName>, left the village of <placeName
                        ref="#fr-laf">La Fouche</placeName> whither they knew not, and cared less,
                    so long as they got there. Hiking was anything but easy, plodding through eight
                    inches of snow, under a sixty-pound pack. Many of the men's shoes were
                    completely unserviceable and they made their first letters from home serve a
                    dual purpose, inserting them in their shoes to keep their feet off the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>There were a great many trucks on the road, all heavily loaded, going in the same
                    direction the troops were marching. <pb facs="image055" />
                    <fw n="40" place="top-left" type="pageNum">40</fw>
                    <fw place="top-center" type="header">The Hike</fw> These trucks had to have the
                    middle of the road. If they veered too much to one side they were sure to skid
                    into the ditch, which meant a delay of perchance a whole day. This forced the
                    men to keep well over to the right of the road where the ground was slanting and
                    the footing uncertain.</p>
                <p>Anybody who ever traveled over a French highway knows what the right hand side
                    looks like. Besides the trees which stand thirty feet apart, the government
                    keeps small piles of crushed rock, stacked between every two trees, for the
                    purpose of repairing the road. So it was around these trees and over these rock
                    piles on the slanting roadside that part of the column had to plod.</p>
                <p>Fifty minutes of hiking and ten minutes of rest per hour was the plan followed.
                    About <date when="1917-12-27T10:00:00">10 o'clock A. M.</date> the column
                    reached <placeName ref="#fr-stb">St. Blin</placeName> and the complete train was
                    once more together for the first time since leaving <placeName ref="#campmills"
                        >Camp Mills</placeName>. The last hike they had taken together was on
                        <placeName ref="nyu-lon">Long Island</placeName>, without packs, over the
                    best roads in the world, on an ideal autumn morning. This reminded them of that
                    hike, because it was so different. In a few minutes the five additional
                    companies had taken their places in line. These five organizations had been in
                    France six weeks, and had made one long hike and had done much outdoor labor. In
                    that respect they were better prepared for the coming ordeal than the group from <choice>

                <p>Someone was setting the pace with a motorcycle, who evidently had no idea what
                    walking in a new-fal1en snow was like. This gait was especially hard on the
                    three companies who had already been hiking for two hours. Within a short time,
                        <orgName ref="#comoku">Oklahoma</orgName>'s four accompanying <q
                        type="soCalled">Flivvers</q> came into demand, as the snow combined with the
                    huge pack, containing most everything a soldier needs but the kitchen stove, had
                    commenced to tell on the embryo campaigners. A few fell out before noon, but as
                    the day grew older, the number of exhausted increased, and the ambulances had
                    all they could do to bring in the stragglers. </p>
                <p>A halt was called <date when="1917-12-27T12:00:00">at noon</date> on the
                    outskirts of <choice>

                    </choice> for lunch. The train marched into an open field by the roadside and
                    there, feet buried in the snow, unslung packs and waited for the wagon train to
                    catch up. When it came, coffee would be made and served. The thermometer stood
                    very close to zero. Every man's clothing was moist from perspiration and it took
                    a very few minutes to chill the men to the bone. Here the foundation was laid
                    for many cases of pneumonia that developed in the next few days for an hour had
                    passed before each man had received his one-third cup of half-boiled black
                    unsweetened coffee.</p>

                <p>Oh! how they wished they had some of the honey they had <q type="soCalled"
                        >bought</q> a few days before. A Frenchman near <placeName ref="#fr-stb">St.
                        Blin</placeName> discovered while the troops were there that a bee-hive had
                    been robbed. The <orgName ref="#st117">sanitary train</orgName> had not seen any
                    of the honey, but they were camped near and were taxed to cover the loss anyway.
                    The lost honey was less than a quart. The bill was six hundred francs, and it
                    was paid. And now, with all their hearts, the men wished they had stolen hives
                    and all. But the bitter coffee was gulped down and the men waited impatiently
                    for the tramp to start again, for they could at least keep warm marching.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, the train passed through <choice>

                    </choice>. The very elements of nature had conspired against them. One hill
                    after another in rapid succession, with hardly ever a descent, combined with a
                    blinding snowstorm, almost a blizzard in form, made progress not only painful
                    but next to impossible. Many of the unseasoned lads fell exhausted into the snow
                    trusting that an ambulance would come along before nightfall. </p>
                <p>About dusk the column reached the little lane leading to the village of <choice>
                        <sic>Echot</sic>
                        <corr><placeName ref="#fr-eco">Ecot</placeName></corr>
                    </choice>, about one kilometer from the main road. <orgName ref="#secam"
                        >Ambulance section headquarters</orgName>, <orgName ref="#comnju"
                        >Jersey</orgName>, <orgName ref="#comtnu">Tennessee</orgName> and <orgName
                        ref="#comneu">Nebraska</orgName>, were assigned to this town for the night.
                    A feeble tubercular cheer arose from the men of these four organizations, for at
                    last the end of the trail was in sight where a place to rest might be had. The
                    billets were good, being in an old chateau and in houses near it. Some of the
                    rooms even had fireplaces and fires were built, though officially there were no
                    fires, for officially there was no fuel. The stack of wood in the court yard
                    belonged to the Frenchman who owned the chateau. Some of the men spent part of
                    their rightful sleeping while trying to negotiate legitimately for the wood, but
                    most of the men pursued a less exemplary, but more practical course, and had a
                    fire. The wife of the old Frenchman took pity on the wet, shivering soldiers and
                    told them to be careful and get the wood between five and six o'clock while her
                    husband was in the back hall milking the goats, or he would make trouble for
                    them. After the fires were roaring and the men were having the novel experience
                    of thawing, they threw their packs on the floor and fell on top of them, too
                    tired to get up two hours later for supper. Soon all minds were dead to the
                    world sleeping only as exhausted men can, dreamless and quiet even upon a
                    mattress of oak. </p>
                <p><orgName ref="#secfh">Field hospital headquarters</orgName> and the five
                    companies who started last, pushed on to <placeName ref="#fr-for"
                        >Forcey</placeName> the same evening, where they were to spend the night.
                    Due to an oversight, probably, it was more than an hour after they arrived in
                    town before billets could <pb facs="image057" />

                    the men assigned places, in spite of the fact that a billeting officer had been
                    sent ahead to prepare for the emergency. At the end of this hour of waiting in
                    the street, the men were rewarded with well-ventilated billets. For there were
                    plenty of holes in the roof and some in the walls as well. These barns were as
                    cold within as the streets without, except that there was a place to take refuge
                    from the winds.</p>
                <p>Morning brought unique problems. Under the hay and blankets the all-essential
                    feet had swollen out of proportion, while on the floor every shoe had frozen
                    stiff. Some of the men lighted candles inside of their shoes, others stuffed
                    them full of hay and set the hay on fire. The barn was full of smoke and
                    resourcefulness, and by <date when="1917-12-28T09:30:00">9:30 o'clock</date>,

                    </choice> arrived, they were ready to go, and go they did, in the same
                    direction, southward and upward, slipping and limping.</p>
                <p>The second day tested the soldier's mettle. After the column had left <placeName
                        ref="#fr-for">Forcey</placeName> an hour behind, snow once more started
                    falling. Again it was driven by a gale that assumed the appearance of a
                    blizzard. The thermometer started falling and continued to drop all day. It was
                    impossible to see a hundred yards ahead. Stragglers increased in number. Men who
                    fell out lay prone in the snow, or sat propped up against trees by the roadside,
                    waiting for the overworked ambulances.</p>
                <p>At <date when="1917-12-28T12:00:00">noon</date> a halt was called for lunch. The
                    meal consisted of cold corned beef sandwiches. The first five minutes saw the
                    sandwiches disappear, but the prescribed hour rest had to be observed, and the
                    airing that went along with it had to be endured. The time was spent in trying
                    prescriptions for keeping warm without a fire. Finally the march was resumed and
                    the men were glad to be on their way once more.</p>
                <p>The afternoon was a repetition of the morning.</p>
                <p>The worst of all calamities befell the <orgName ref="#comneu"
                        >Nebraskans</orgName>. Their kitchen was in the ditch, incidentally, the
                    accident occurred just before noon. The hill had been hard for those on foot,
                    but for the donkeys and wagon, it had been too much. The mules tried and failed.
                    The driver coaxed the team in ways known only to his profession and failed. Then
                    men were called to help, and they were successful in pushing the load half way
                    up the grade where it slipped and ran backward, off the road and upside down.
                    Then the air grew warm, for if <persName ref="#wtsherman">Sherman</persName> had
                    been in <placeName ref="#fr">France</placeName> instead of <placeName ref="#gau"
                        >Georgia</placeName> he would have used more than three words to describe
                    war.</p>
                <p>The whole wagon train was stuck. This meant to summon help from the <q><orgName

                    Much confab followed. After wild gestures with head and limbs and a discreet use
                    of a few familiar words, the <q>Frog</q> understood. He thereupon spat out a
                    string of <q type="foreign" xml:lang="fr">oui',</q> and departed, returning
                    presently with a yoke of oxen. One at a time the wagons were towed to the top of
                    the hill, and the wagon train struggled on. The Frenchman accepted two cane of
                        <q>corned bill</q> for his trouble and seemed delighted with the
                    remuneration. If this had been the last hill, all would have been well, but
                    there were others. Twice that afternoon it was necessary to remove half the load
                    from each wagon at the foot of the hill, and pull the rest to the top, sending
                    the wagons back to get the rest of the load.</p>

                        headquarters</orgName> were to spend their second night there and they
                    halted for the day. It was a small town of hospitable people and airy billets,
                    and the temperature had fallen ten degrees below zero, Fahrenheit.</p>
                <p>Again the other five companies struggled a little farther on, halting at
                        <placeName ref="#fr-nog">Nogent-en-Bassigny</placeName> where they were
                    quartered. It was their turn for better quarters, and they got them. The billets
                    were warm and the cafes in town had hot meals for sale. Needless to say, they
                    did a rushing business. The men profited by the experience of the night before
                    and took their shoes to bed with them, where the heat of their bodies prevented
                    them from freezing. And the next morning the thermometer was hovering around
                    fifteen below zero.</p>
                <p>The men in <placeName ref="#fr-man">Mandres</placeName> did not take off any of
                    their clothes. They were ready to start at the first bugle note, when they threw
                    themselves free from their blankets and <date when="1917-12-29T08:00:00">8
                        o'clock</date> found the column on the road again. Every man was traveling
                    on his nerve next day. A number of the hikers had to be left behind at
                        <placeName ref="#fr-man">Mandres</placeName> to be called for by ambulances
                    later. The rest of the train fell in line at <placeName ref="#fr-nog"
                        >Nogent</placeName> about <date when="1917-12-29T09:30:00">9:30</date>. The
                    column was shorter by this time but the train was on the home stretch at last.
                    Those hardy ones remaining were rewarded by a few rays of sun. Even the early
                    morning was bright and before <date when="1917-12-29T10:00:00">10 o'clock</date>
                    the weather started to moderate. Hiking was comfortable, even though every man
                    was tired and footsore. </p>
                <p>At <date when="1917-12-29T12:00:00">noon on December 29</date>, the commander of
                    the column called a halt in the village of <placeName ref="#fr-rol"
                        >Rolampont</placeName>, where <orgName ref="#div42">42nd Division
                        Headquarters</orgName> was already situated. The ambulance men had reached
                    their destination.</p>
                <p>A reason was never stated for making the Christmas hike. <pb facs="image059" />

                    called a practice march. Sometimes it was called a strategic retreat from the
                        <placeName ref="#fr-tou">Toul sector</placeName> where unusual activity was
                    threatened. But neither was authenticated. To the men it was a campaign, and by
                    no means the easiest one in the war. Whatever the purpose might have been, that
                    purpose was thwarted by the unexpected blizzard. If it was planned as a
                    hardening and strengthening maneuver for the men, the plan was frustrated, for
                    the worst blizzard of an unusually severe winter on the <geogName ref="#fr-lng"
                        >Langres plateau</geogName> overtook them before the journey was half
                    made.</p>
                <p>The most unhappy recollections of the service overseas are draped about the
                    happenings during this early campaign against cold and unfitness for hardships.
                    The flies and stench and sleepless nights of the month at <placeName
                        ref="#fr-cth">Chateau-Thierry</placeName> ; the muck and bottomless roads
                    and ceaseless rain and hostile bombers of <geogName ref="#fr-arg">the
                        Argonne</geogName> ; neither was hard enough to make the men complain,
                    because at that time they understood the necessity of it all. And in those later
                    months they understood that this first battle with King Winter was only the
                    reward of a volunteer, who came early to be sacrificed to the American cause
                    while it was still in the experimental stage. The discontent at the time was due
                    to the apparent non-necessity of it all, or perhaps memories of comrades who
                    need not have died.</p>
                <p>Refreshed by an eighteen hour rest, the four hospital companies with their
                    headquarters detachment renewed the march from <placeName ref="#fr-rol"

                    was clear and fair and had advantages over some of the foregoing ones, but it
                    was a painful hike. They passed on over the heights of <geogName ref="#fr-lng"

                <p>They marched into regulation French barracks, with floors of soft mud and a small
                    sheet-iron stove at one end. They made themselves comfortable there and waited
